This disparity clashes with Smith's vision of a society where individual self-interest, guided by the invisible hand, ultimately benefits the collective good. The 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 900, aligns more closely with this principle, even though it means forgoing a potentially larger personal reward. I believe this choice reflects a preference for a more balanced outcome, consistent with the spirit of Smith's teachings on economic fairness and the common good.
