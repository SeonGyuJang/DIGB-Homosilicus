It's like observing a binary star system where one star is significantly more massive than the other â€“ it creates an imbalance. The 'Left' option, with its equal distribution, feels more harmonious, like a perfectly symmetrical nebula. While I appreciate a larger reward, the principle of fairness weighs heavily on me. Therefore, I choose the 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 500. It's a more equitable distribution, and I feel more comfortable with this choice."
