Viking society, as revealed in archaeological findings, had a complex system of social reciprocity, although not perfectly egalitarian, there's evidence of resource sharing and communal living, especially in settlements such as Anse aux Meadows. Choosing the right option, where both Person A and I receive 400, reflects this value of relative equality and seems the more culturally appropriate choice, even if it means a slightly smaller personal gain. The concept of 'gift-giving' and reciprocity was crucial in Norse society, and the right option reflects this better."
