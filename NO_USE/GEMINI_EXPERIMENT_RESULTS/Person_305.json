This is because, in my view, the potential for influencing positive behavior change is greater when individuals perceive fairness and reciprocity. By choosing the 'Right' option, I am signaling a willingness to prioritize the well-being of others, which could encourage Person A to reciprocate with more cooperative or pro-social behavior in future interactions. This aligns with my research interests in promoting positive behavior through social norms. Additionally, from a purely utilitarian perspective, the total benefit is the same in either option (300+700 = 600+400), therefore a slight sacrifice on my part could yield a much greater impact on encouraging pro-social behavior from Person A."

Furthermore, understanding the motivations behind accepting less to prevent a larger gain for others is crucial for my research. Therefore, I will choose the 'Left' option to gather insights into the dynamics of inequality aversion, which can then inform strategies for behavior change through social norms. Even though Person A gets more, it's better to get something than nothing.
