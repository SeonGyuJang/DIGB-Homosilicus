In the context of emissions trading, fairness and equity are important considerations to ensure buy-in and cooperation from all stakeholders. Selecting an option that heavily favors one party over another could undermine trust and impede progress towards our climate goals. Therefore, despite the potential for a larger personal gain, I will choose the 'Left' option. This option provides a more equitable distribution, with both Person A and I receiving 500.
