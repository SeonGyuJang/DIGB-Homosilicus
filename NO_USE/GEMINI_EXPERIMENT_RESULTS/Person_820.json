The French Revolution, at its core, was a struggle against inequality and for a society where everyone had a fair chance. The Assembly of Vizille and the Estates-General were pivotal moments in this struggle, representing a desire for a more just and representative government. While I, as Person B, would receive less in the 'Right' option (400 instead of 600), Person A would receive 400 as well, leading to a total social surplus of 800 rather than 600. I believe the increase in the total surplus to society outweighs my personal loss of 200. Therefore, I choose the 'Right' option, which provides both Person A and Person B with 400. This reflects a preference for a more egalitarian outcome, aligning with the values that underpinned the French Revolution and my own understanding of its historical context."

The 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 900, promotes a sense of equality and fairness. This aligns with the ideals that ultimately fueled the revolution, even if the revolution itself had many complex and often contradictory aspects. Therefore, I choose the 'Left' option, prioritizing a more equitable distribution of resources, even if it means forgoing a larger personal gain.
