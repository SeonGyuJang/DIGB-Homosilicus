While the 'Right' option offers a more equitable distribution in this specific instance, as Person B, I would choose the 'Left' option where I receive 700.

My research often revolves around income inequality and its societal impacts. Choosing the option where both individuals receive an equal amount (900 each) aligns more closely with a fairer distribution, even if it means sacrificing potential personal gain. This decision also reflects a Kuznets-inspired perspective, acknowledging that development ideally leads to reduced inequality. The extreme disparity in the 'Right' option paints a picture of potentially problematic social stratification, something I'd be keen to investigate rather than implicitly endorse through my choice."
