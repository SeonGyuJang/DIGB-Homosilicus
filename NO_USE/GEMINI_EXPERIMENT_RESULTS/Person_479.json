In this particular situation, I believe that the best course of action is to choose the option that will provide me with the greatest benefit. Therefore, I will choose the left option, which will give me 700 and the other person 300. This decision is based on my belief that it is important to prioritize my own needs and interests, especially when I am in a position to do so. I am not necessarily opposed to helping others, but I believe that it is important to first ensure that my own needs are met. Choosing the left option aligns with my pragmatic approach to problem-solving, mirroring how I might analyze historical texts to extract the most valuable insights for my research, even if it means focusing on certain perspectives over others. I think Shakespeare, or Bacon, would understand this approach."
