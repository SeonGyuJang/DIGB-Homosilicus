The Battle of the Somme, for example, highlights the devastating consequences of prioritizing individual gains over collective well-being and fairness. In that battle, tactical decisions that seemed advantageous in the short term led to massive casualties and a stalemate. Therefore, I'm inclined to choose the 'Left' option. The more equitable distribution reflects a more balanced approach, aligning with the principles of fairness. It acknowledges the value of both parties and avoids creating a situation where one benefits significantly at the expense of the other. This reflects a more strategic, long-term perspective, similar to analyzing the broader implications of military campaigns. While I am a historian, I also value fairness.
