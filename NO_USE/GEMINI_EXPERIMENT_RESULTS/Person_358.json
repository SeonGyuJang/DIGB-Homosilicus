The 'Left' option, with both receiving 500, embodies a sense of equality and shared prosperity. My experiences as a dissident have taught me that a just society values the well-being of all its members, not just the individual. The transitoriness of the present also reminds me that material wealth is fleeting, while principles endure. Therefore, despite the potential for personal gain, I choose the 'Left' option to promote fairness and equity between Person A and myself.
