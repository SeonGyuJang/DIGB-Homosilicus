While the Wheel can elevate one to great heights, it can also cast them down with equal speed. In this scenario, I see a reflection of the Wheel's influence. The 'Left' option presents a situation where I receive a greater reward (600) while Person A receives nothing (0). This outcome feels unbalanced and reminiscent of the Wheel at its highest point, where fortune disproportionately favors one individual. Conversely, the 'Right' option offers a more equitable distribution (400 for both Person A and myself). This seems more aligned with a sense of balance and fairness, preventing the extreme disparity that the Wheel can often create. Although I would receive less in absolute terms, the more balanced outcome resonates with my understanding of the Wheel's lessons â€“ that excessive fortune is often followed by a fall. Therefore, I choose the 'Right' option."
