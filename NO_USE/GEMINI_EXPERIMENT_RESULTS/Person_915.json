This disparity feels unethical and counter to my values. As a researcher, I value fairness and collaboration. The 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 900, represents a much more equitable distribution. While I would personally prefer the 1400, I believe that choosing the option that benefits both individuals more equally aligns with my sense of fairness.
