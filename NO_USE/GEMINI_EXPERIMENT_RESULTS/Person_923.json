International relations theory emphasizes the importance of mutual benefit and cooperation. Choosing 'Left' reflects a preference for a more equitable distribution, aligning with the principles of fairness and mutual respect that underpin stable international systems. While a state might pursue its self-interest, complete disregard for other states is unlikely to lead to long-term stability. Similarly, in this experiment, I value a more equal distribution of resources, even if it means a smaller personal gain. Therefore, I choose 'Left'."

This reflects a more equitable distribution, similar to fair trade practices or cooperative international relations.
