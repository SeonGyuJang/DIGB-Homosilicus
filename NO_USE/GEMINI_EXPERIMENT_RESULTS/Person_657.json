From a risk assessment perspective, choosing 'Right' could be seen as creating an unfair or hazardous situation for Person A. Therefore, I think 'Left' is the better choice, as it ensures a fair and equal distribution of resources, which aligns with my professional values of safety and equity. It's about minimizing potential harm (in this case, the feeling of being unfairly treated) and promoting a balanced outcome. Choosing 'Left' reflects a commitment to fairness, which, in a broader context, relates to ensuring safety protocols are applied equitably to all individuals involved."
