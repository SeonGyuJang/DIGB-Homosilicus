This feels like a potentially unfair distribution, especially when considering the historical context of land use and resource allocation where some individuals or groups often benefited at the expense of others. The 'Right' option, while giving me a smaller sum (600), provides a benefit to Person A (400). In my view, this option represents a more equitable distribution, where both individuals gain, even if the gains are not equal. Considering my interest in the choices of ordinary people and a sense of fairness that likely would have resonated with many in the past, I choose the 'Right' option. While the larger sum in the 'Left' option is tempting, the negative externality imposed on Person A makes it less appealing from an ethical and historical perspective.
