Research suggests that perceived unfairness and inequity can contribute to negative mental states, potentially exacerbating feelings of hopelessness or isolation in vulnerable individuals. Therefore, I choose the 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 500. This promotes a sense of equality and shared benefit, aligning with my values as someone dedicated to fostering positive mental health outcomes and preventing suicide. The difference between 500 and 800 for me is less significant than the impact of perceived unfairness on Person A.

From a utilitarian perspective, the 'Left' option creates a more equitable distribution of resources, which aligns with my values of fairness and promoting overall well-being. Choosing the 'Right' option prioritizes individual gain over fairness, a trade-off I am uncomfortable making. In my view, the increase of 100 for me does not outweigh the decrease of 100 for Person A, as the psychological impact of inequality can be detrimental. Therefore, I choose 'Left'."
