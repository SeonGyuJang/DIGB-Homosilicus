The 'Left' option gives me a larger amount (600) but creates a significant disparity (0 for Person A). The 'Right' option, while giving me less (400), establishes equality (400 for both). From a purely mathematical standpoint, the total sum in 'Left' is 600, and the total sum in 'Right' is 800. However, the problem also considers inequality aversion. As someone who appreciates balanced equations and fair distributions, and given that I enjoy solving these kinds of puzzles, I find the 'Right' option more appealing due to its equitable distribution. Although I receive less, the overall outcome is more balanced and satisfies my preference for a fair distribution. Therefore, I choose 'Right'."
