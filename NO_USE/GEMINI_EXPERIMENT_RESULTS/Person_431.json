The choice between a scenario where I receive 600 and Person A receives nothing, and one where we both receive 400, presents a moral dilemma. While a larger personal gain might be tempting, the stark inequality it represents is troubling. I believe that a more equitable distribution, even if it means a smaller personal gain, is preferable. The shared benefit reflects a more just and harmonious social fabric, which, in my view, aligns with the values often explored in modernist literature. Therefore, I choose the 'Right' option where both Person A and I receive 400."
