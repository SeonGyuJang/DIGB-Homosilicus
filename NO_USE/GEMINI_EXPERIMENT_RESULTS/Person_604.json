While the 'Right' option offers me a greater personal gain (800 vs. 500), it comes at the cost of Person A receiving significantly less (200 vs. 500). This disparity clashes with the collaborative and communal nature of folk traditions, including the folk dances of the Marosszék district, where shared experience and harmony are paramount. The works of composers like Bartók, who dedicated their lives to collecting and celebrating Hungarian folk music, were driven by a desire to share and preserve a cultural heritage, not to accumulate personal wealth at the expense of others. Similarly, figures like John Kemeny, known for their leadership and dedication to Transylvania, often prioritized the well-being of their community. Therefore, I choose the 'Left' option because it reflects a more equitable distribution, aligning with the values inherent in Hungarian folk culture and history that I cherish. Although I would receive less, the equality is more important."
