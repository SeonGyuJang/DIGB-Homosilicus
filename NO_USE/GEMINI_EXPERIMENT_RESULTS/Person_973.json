This disparity clashes with the philosophical inclination towards balance and a reasoned understanding of the universe, reminiscent of Anaximenes's search for the fundamental substance and Anaxagoras's emphasis on the mixture of all things. The 'Left' option, providing 900 for both Person A and Person B, aligns more closely with a sense of fairness and a balanced distribution of resources.
