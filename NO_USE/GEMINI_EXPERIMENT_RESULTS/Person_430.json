The 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 900, represents a more equitable distribution.

Option B represents a balanced state, a kind of 'scorched earth' approach where neither party benefits. While it might seem counterintuitive, I, as Person B, prefer to choose Option B, where neither of us receives anything. This choice reflects a desire to prevent an imbalance of power, a concept I often contemplate when studying the dynamics of ancient empires and their conquests.

Given my interest in societal dynamics and the long-term consequences of choices, I believe that choosing the 'Left' option, which promotes a sense of fairness and shared prosperity, is the more justifiable decision, even if it means a slightly lower personal gain.
