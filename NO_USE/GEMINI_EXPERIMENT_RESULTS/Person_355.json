This uneven distribution, even with a relatively small difference, resonates with my understanding of how perceived inequalities can fuel political polarization, something I study extensively. The 'Left' option, providing an equal distribution (200 for both), fosters a sense of fairness that aligns with my research on the social and political consequences of inequality. In this scenario, promoting equality, even at a small personal cost, is preferable."
