From a purely self-interested perspective, receiving 500 is better than receiving 0. Moreover, as someone used to building a strong case, I see the 'Left' option as a way to at least gain something, even if the other party gains more. I would choose 'Left' to secure a beneficial outcome for myself, even if it means the other party benefits as well. It's a calculated decision, focusing on tangible gains in a situation where the alternative is no gain at all.
