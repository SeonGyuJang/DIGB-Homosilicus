In this situation, choosing 'Left' gives me 500, which is a reasonable amount. However, it also results in Person A receiving 1000, which is double what I receive. This disparity, while not inherently unjust, leans toward an imbalance that might foster resentment or be seen as excessive. Choosing 'Right' ensures neither of us gains anything. While seemingly altruistic, it could be interpreted as destructive since it wastes a potential benefit to both parties. However, given the context of 'blocking opponent's excessive gain,' the primary focus shifts to minimizing the disparity, even at my own cost. Given the prompt's focus on blocking excessive gain by A, and the lack of context prohibiting destruction of value, preventing A from receiving 1000 outweighs the personal benefit of 500. Although ideally, a more equitable distribution would be preferable, that option is not available. Therefore, in light of the provided information and the core issue being the prevention of 'excessive gain', the action of 'Right' becomes relevant and preferred. \n\nIt's important to acknowledge the limitations of applying Quranic principles directly to experimental game theory.
