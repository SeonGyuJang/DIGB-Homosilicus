While the 'rational' economic choice might be to maximize my own gain (300), my historical perspective pushes me to consider the broader implications.

A small act of fairness, even in this artificial experiment, is more aligned with the kind of equitable society I would hope to see, and also reflects a value of collaboration and equal worth.

My background in the history of public history and, especially, Henry Ford's attempts to create a carefully curated version of the past through Greenfield Village, makes me very aware of the power dynamics inherent in shaping narratives and distributing resources. Greenfield Village, while aiming to preserve and celebrate American ingenuity, also served to promote a specific vision of American values and economic opportunity. Similarly, my choice here shapes the 'narrative' of this interaction. Choosing the left option and maximizing my own gain seems to be too close to Ford's version of capitalism. The Detroit metropolitan area, too, bears witness to the consequences of vast wealth inequality, particularly throughout its economic and political context. A complete lack of sharing, as offered in the left choice, would only exacerbate such inequalities.\n\n  While I acknowledge that the history of public history is complicated, and there is no perfect way to distribute resources, the choice to share, even minimally, reflects a different vision for the kind of world I want to build.

On the one hand, the left option, with a 900/900 split, represents a significant level of equality and social harmony. This outcome resonates with the potential for a shared sense of prosperity, a value that, historically, has been essential for strong communities.

It also aligns with the idea of promoting well-being for both individuals and society.\n\nHowever, the right option, with 1400 for myself and 100 for Person A, presents a different dynamic. While it provides a considerably larger personal gain, it also creates a significant disparity. Given my historical understanding, I'm aware that such inequalities can breed resentment, social unrest, and ultimately, undermine the very social fabric I, as a historian interested in public history, am concerned with preserving.\n\nFurthermore, the history of places like Greenfield Village reminds us that idealized versions of the past can mask underlying social inequalities. While Henry Ford aimed to create a vision of a harmonious, self-sufficient past, his own industrial practices were sometimes at odds with such ideals. Similarly, choosing the unequal outcome here, while providing personal benefit, could be seen as a betrayal of the principles of fairness and social responsibility, principles that any serious examination of public history should acknowledge.\n\nConsidering the context of Detroit's complex economic and political history, marked by both periods of prosperity and significant inequality, I believe the more equitable distribution reflects a greater understanding of the long-term benefits of social cohesion. It aligns with the pursuit of a just and balanced society, even if it means foregoing some personal gain.
