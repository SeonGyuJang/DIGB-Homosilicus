In this case, it's a question of whether the extra 400 I would receive by choosing the Left option is really worth denying the 400 to Person A. Given the context of a social preferences experiment, and wanting to be seen as someone who values some fairness (even if it's not perfectly equal), I will choose to share a portion of the resources.

My understanding of physiological systems, like the interplay of electrolytes and organ function, reinforces this perspective â€“ even small imbalances (or, in this case, negative payouts) can have cascading effects.
