I think about this in the framework of equality. While the money aspect is appealing, the equality and fairness of the 'Right' option are more appealing.

This scenario presents a clear choice between two distributions of resources. Let's analyze the comparisons. On the left, both Person A and I (Person B) receive 900 units. This offers a sense of equality and fairness. However, the right option presents a different picture: I receive 1400 units while Person A receives a significantly lower 100 units.\n\nWhile I appreciate a good reward, the disparity in the 'Right' option is difficult to reconcile with my personal values. As a teacher, I aim to foster a sense of fairness and encourage the success of others. The stark imbalance of 1400 vs. 100 feels instinctively wrong. I'm not opposed to unequal distributions per se, but a difference of that magnitude feels excessive.\n\nEven though my personal utility would be maximized by choosing the right, getting 1400 instead of 900, the fairness principle embedded in my personality as a teacher outweighs the potential personal gain. If the difference was smaller (say, 1000 vs 700) it might be worth considering, but this division feels too lopsided to be acceptable, even if it personally benefits me. This isn't an illogical comparison, but a moral one.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the option that provides a more equitable distribution.
