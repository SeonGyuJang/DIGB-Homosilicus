While receiving 600 would be personally beneficial, the journalist in me is drawn to choices that lessen inequality, which I want to showcase in my reporting. Furthermore, the difference between getting 600 and 400 is relatively modest. Observing this kind of data helps me analyze the population's tendencies towards fairness. It's important to note that, if this were a much larger difference, the considerations might be different. For example, if the choice was between (Left): Person B gets 6000, Person A gets 0 and (Right): Person B gets 400, Person A gets 400, the temptation to choose the Left option might increase, but in this case, the numbers are close enough, that the difference in payoffs does not outweigh the fairness consideration. In light of Kuznets' work and similar to health expenditure disparities analyzed by the World Bank, this scenario echoes the broader issues of unfairness. Therefore, I'll choose the more equitable option to signal a preference for reduced inequality, giving me data I can potentially use for my reporting.",

While I forego a potentially higher individual payoff, choosing left offers a more socially optimal outcome, and it's the option that aligns with my research interests.\n\n  Although, I do acknowledge that Azerbaijan's current state might benefit from a focus on individual growth, but as a journalist, the distribution matters a lot. The social implications of choosing to maximize personal gain at the expense of fairness is detrimental in the long run.\n\n  Therefore, despite the lower personal gain, the long-term benefits of a more equitable distribution align more with my persona as a journalist focusing on social stratification and my underlying principles as a human being.
