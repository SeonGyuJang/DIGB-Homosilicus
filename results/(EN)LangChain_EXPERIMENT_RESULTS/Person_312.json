In this specific, isolated scenario, though, the direct impact of the choice is limited. The decision comes down to pure self-interest versus a gesture towards fairness. While increasing skin cancer screening and public awareness are my professional drivers, in this controlled experiment where neither choice has any correlation to that goal, I have to consider the inherent equality in the 'Left' option.

However, since this is not the case, I will prioritize the more equitable outcome. However, the disparity of the options is significant. 300 to me and 300 less to A is a large difference.
