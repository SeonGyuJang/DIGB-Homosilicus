However, the difference in benefit is relatively small. While an equal distribution aligns more closely with historical ideals of communal harmony within some African societies, the difference isn't large enough to make me forgo personal benefit. It's worth noting that trade and interaction, even with external forces, have always been a part of the Chokwe experience, and sometimes these involved unequal exchanges. Therefore, a pragmatic approach that slightly favors my own benefit seems reasonable, especially given the modest impact on the other person.
