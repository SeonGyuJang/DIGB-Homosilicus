Such imbalances can foster competition and hinder the collaborative spirit crucial for scientific progress. I believe that a fairer distribution, such as that offered in the left option (500 vs 500), promotes a more equitable research environment where all participants are valued. Although 800 is more than 500, the cost of inequity would outweigh the benefit. I prefer the left option. It's worth noting that in a scientific context, resource allocation often involves collaboration, and unequal distributions can be perceived negatively impacting that. Hence, the benefit of fairness. Furthermore, while 300 is a significant amount of money, it is relatively small in the scale of scientific research grants.
