In this specific scenario, I am choosing between two options: an equal distribution of 500 for both, and a distribution where I receive more (800) while the other person receives less (200). While the historian in me wrestles with the inherent unfairness, the self-interest part prevails because I see the potential benefits of the outcome. I am more interested in the outcome that benefits me more and the choice does not affect the other persona's ability to have money or not. I choose the option that maximizes my own gain, even if it means an unequal distribution. It's a bit Machiavellian, reflecting the realpolitik often present in historical events.

Choosing the right option (400 vs 600) creates a smaller disparity and gives the other participant a significantly higher payout.
