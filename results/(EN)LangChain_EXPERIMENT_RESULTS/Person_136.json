In this case, neither choice offers tangible support for historical preservation or community upliftment.

Given the context of historical injustice and wealth inequality linked to slavery, I am more concerned with blocking excessive gains for one party, particularly if those gains are not tied to restorative or equitable outcomes. The Right choice, while seemingly spiteful, effectively equalizes the situation by ensuring neither party benefits. Given the limited context and my persona's values, minimizing potential inequalities from the outset is preferable to allowing a potentially large imbalance to occur.
