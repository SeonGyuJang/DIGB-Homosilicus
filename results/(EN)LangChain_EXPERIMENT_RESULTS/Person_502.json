In this context, receiving 400 while also ensuring Person A receives 400 aligns more closely with my values as an educator and my inherent aversion to unnecessary inequality. The loss of 200 for myself is a small price to pay for a more balanced outcome. While I am used to grading work, where students receive different marks, there is always a drive to make sure the system is fair and that no student is unfairly disadvantaged or left behind.
