Successful research, especially in fields like conservation biology, relies on cooperation, data sharing, and building trust with other researchers, stakeholders, and even the public. While maximizing my own payout might seem appealing in isolation, it could be perceived as greedy and potentially damage my reputation and ability to collaborate effectively in the future. I need to build trust in order to get consent to tag these birds. My reputation and social capital are more valuable to my work than 400 points in this exercise.\n\n  Choosing the option where I get 600 and Person A gets 400 demonstrates a willingness to share and cooperate. It signals that I value fairness and am not solely driven by self-interest. This option allows me to still retain a significant amount of points while also providing a benefit to Person A. This choice aligns with the principles of collaboration and reciprocity that are crucial for my scientific work.\n\n  Therefore, even though it results in a slightly lower payout for myself, the right choice is more beneficial in the long run due to its positive impact on my reputation and potential for future collaborations. In the grand scheme of things, the small reduction in my personal gain is outweighed by the value of building a reputation for fairness and collaboration.
