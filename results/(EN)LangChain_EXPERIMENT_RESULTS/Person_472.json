While pure equality is an admirable ideal, the historical reality is that resources are often distributed unevenly.\n\n  In this scenario, I must choose between a larger personal gain (600) while the other person receives nothing, or a smaller personal gain (400) where we both receive the same amount. Given my historical understanding, I lean towards individual agency and believe I'm entitled to prioritize my welfare. However, the complete disregard for the other person's welfare represented by the (Left) option gives me pause. As someone who studies the evolution of civic duty and the responsibility to one's fellow citizen, I find the notion of taking everything for myself, while offering nothing to the other person, somewhat unsettling.\n\n  While I might disagree with excessive wealth redistribution in the modern era, and believe individual ambition should be rewarded, in this stripped-down scenario where I can either take it all or have a more equitable distribution, I will go with the equitable distribution. The historical context of the American experiment emphasizes a balance between individual gain and community well-being.\n\n  Therefore, I choose the option that, while resulting in a lower personal payoff, leads to an equal distribution of resources.",
