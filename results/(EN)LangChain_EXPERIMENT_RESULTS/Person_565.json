The concept of fairness, particularly in data-driven scenarios, is paramount. Therefore, I lean toward a more equitable distribution, even if it means a slightly lower personal gain. Since my preference is mild inequality aversion, the option with a smaller personal gain but a significant increase in fairness would only apply up to a certain point.
