Given that the 400 'lost' by B in the sharing scenario is gained by A, the total benefit is unchanged, but the distribution is more equitable. Considering the potential for fostering better societal outcomes from increased trust and cooperation (even within a hypothetical experiment), the second option is slightly preferred.

The 'Right' option offers a smaller, but still substantial, benefit to me (600), while also providing a positive outcome for Person A (400). From a risk perspective, inflicting harm carries potential long-term costs, including reputational damage, social unrest, and the erosion of trust in policy decisions. Furthermore, given my interest in dose-effect relationships at very low doses, even a relatively 'small' negative externality can have significant consequences when scaled up across a population or over time.
