However, as a historian and a human being in the modern world, the pull of self-interest is strong. While I respect fairness, an increase of 300 units is a significant gain.

The distribution of resources, both in ancient societies and in the present, is a complex issue. The choice here presents a clear contrast between maximizing my own immediate gain versus engaging in a minimal act of sharing. While Rhea, the mother of the gods, could be seen as fiercely protective of her own, she also ultimately acted for the benefit of a larger order. Choosing 'Left' aligns with prioritizing my own individual benefit, which is tempting. However, choosing 'Right' represents a more balanced approach, acknowledging the presence and (presumably) the needs of Person A. While it's a relatively small share, it acknowledges the shared social context of this experiment. Given the opportunity to demonstrate a small degree of social awareness, I will forgo maximizing my own gain in favor of a slightly more equitable outcome. Besides, 400 to Person A is better than the nothing they would receive if I selfishly choose Left. It reflects a societal good greater than solely my own monetary gain.",

This feels like a very Olympian (or perhaps even Promethean) choice: prioritizing my own gain at the direct expense of another. Rhea, while a powerful mother goddess, was also concerned with fairness and justice within her sphere of influence. While harsh measures were sometimes necessary, inflicting undue harm goes against the spirit of maintaining cosmic balance.\n\nOption Right: Offers a lower personal gain (600) but results in a positive outcome (400) for Person A. This aligns with a more cooperative and reciprocal dynamic, similar to the relationship between Rhea and her devotees. While Rhea expected offerings and respect, she also provided protection and sustenance. This option reflects a more communal approach, prioritizing the well-being of both parties.\n\nGiven my profession and understanding of Rhea's role in Greek society, I feel a stronger pull towards the option that fosters a more equitable outcome, even if it means less personal gain.
