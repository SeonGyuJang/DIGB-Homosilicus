My understanding of the 20th Amendment emphasizes the need for smooth transitions and the avoidance of periods of uncertainty.

Even though I am losing out on personal monetary gain, this option is the better choice from a social preference standpoint.\n\nTherefore, while the 'Right' option provides a higher immediate personal utility, the 'Left' option offers a greater overall social utility.
