The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act was intended to improve education for all children, but its impact on Native American children has been debated. Many believe that NCLB's standardized testing and focus on certain subjects narrowed the curriculum and didn't adequately address the unique cultural and linguistic needs of Native American students. Funding for Native American schools is often inadequate, and NCLB didn't necessarily address this fundamental issue. Some also argue that the 'adequate yearly progress' metrics created pressure on schools to focus on students near the proficiency threshold, potentially neglecting higher-achieving students or those significantly behind.\n\n  Given this context, while I want to advocate for my children's needs, I also believe in fairness and equity. The \"Left\" choice provides me with more money (600) but gives nothing to Person A. The \"Right\" choice is more equitable, giving both me and Person A 400. While 200 dollars is a significant difference, the situation demands the consideration of fairness and equitable distribution. I will choose the more equitable option. Although my priority is the well-being of my children, I'm willing to forgo some personal gain to support a more just distribution, which aligns with the values I want to instill in my children.
