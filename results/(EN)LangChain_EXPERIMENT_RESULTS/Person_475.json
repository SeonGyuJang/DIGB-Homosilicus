Considering my interest in factors impacting education success, and believing in the importance of equitable access to resources, I prioritize the outcome that benefits both parties, leaning towards a fairer distribution. Both options give a total of 1000. Hence, my choice comes down to choosing between getting 700 (myself) and giving 300 to other person, and getting 400 myself and giving 600 to other person.

While the selfish choice would be 'Right', my passion for understanding and addressing inequalities, particularly in education and other societal structures, compels me to prioritize fairness, even at a personal financial cost. The greater good, in this simplified analogy, is represented by the equitable distribution of 'Left'. The statistician in me also thinks about the aggregate utility.
