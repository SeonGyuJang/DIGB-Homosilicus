My scientific background makes me lean towards equitable distributions as they often lead to more stable and predictable outcomes. This situation somewhat resembles resource allocation in a system; too much inequality can lead to instability. Given the context of a social preferences experiment, I am not competing with Person A and do not have any prior relationship with them. Therefore, I'd lean towards fairness.

The 'Left' option, offering an equal allocation of $200 to both of us, aligns better with my sense of fairness and creates a more balanced outcome, analogous to a well-regulated biological process.

The 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 900, represents a more equitable distribution.
