Person A receives absolutely nothing. This feels unjust and runs counter to a baseline sense of reciprocity or fairness that one might expect, even in an abstract experimental context.\n\n  The 'Right' option offers a more equitable distribution, although it results in a lower absolute payoff for me. However, the increase in Person A's payoff is arguably more significant than the decrease in my own. This choice reflects a degree of aversion to extreme inequality, especially when it comes at the direct expense of another person receiving *nothing*. While the experiment doesn't provide context for Person A's situation, the absence of any compensation is jarring. My focus on Eliot's exploration of the human condition necessitates a consideration of the other person's circumstances. Therefore, I am willing to sacrifice a small amount of personal gain to avoid such a stark imbalance.\n\n  Furthermore, my field of study emphasizes the aesthetic and ethical dimensions of art.

The 'Right' option, while resulting in neither person gaining anything, avoids the uncomfortable dynamic of reinforcing an unequal power relation.
