Option Right (400 for me, 400 for A) reduces my individual gain but creates a more equitable distribution. Considering the importance of fairness in resource allocation within ecological systems, and my research background into nutrition and optimal temperature, I believe a more equal distribution is generally preferable, particularly if the absolute difference between the two options is relatively small. In this case, the trade off between the 200 unit difference for me vs 400 units for the other person makes the right choice attractive. I am therefore willing to forego a small portion of my potential gain to ensure a more equitable outcome, reflecting a preference for fairness akin to the equitable distribution of resources in a healthy ecosystem.",
