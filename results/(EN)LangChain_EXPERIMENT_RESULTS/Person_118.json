Option Right provides a lower absolute payoff for me but results in perfect equality, with both Person A and myself receiving 400.\n\n  Given the context of a social preferences experiment, my knowledge of human behavior suggests that participants frequently sacrifice personal gain to reduce inequality.

It creates a more equitable distribution, potentially fostering more positive interactions in subsequent rounds (if any) and aligns with the broader understanding that humans often value fairness even at a personal cost. Further, there is a large difference in fairness, for a relatively small difference in payout.\n\n  Therefore, I choose Option Right to promote equality, even though it results in a lower payoff for me.",

A more equitable distribution increases the likelihood of Person A engaging in future interactions, leading to higher overall benefits for both of us in the long run. Furthermore, as someone involved in the transmission of signals, maintaining trust and cooperation are invaluable signals, and a choice to take a less equitable outcome is more likely to send signals that degrade the trust relationship.\n\nTherefore, while the immediate monetary benefit of choosing 'Right' is tempting, the long-term social and energetic implications of choosing 'Left' are more desirable.
