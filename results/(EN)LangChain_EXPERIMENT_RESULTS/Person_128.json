In this context, giving Person A 1000 while only getting 500 could be seen as a situation where Person A benefits disproportionately. While 500 is positive, the disparity is significant. A union's role is to ensure fair distribution and prevent exploitation. Although I would personally prefer more, the huge difference between the payouts necessitates blocking excessive gain for person A.\n\n  Therefore, the more justifiable choice for a union representative focused on fairness is to choose the 'Right' option, even though it means foregoing a personal gain of 500, because the payoff difference is so huge.",
