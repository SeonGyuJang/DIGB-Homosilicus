The history of Normandy is full of examples of disparity leading to conflict.\n\n  However, this is a purely hypothetical scenario with no real-world consequences beyond the experiment. There's no indication of a larger societal benefit to choosing the equal distribution. Furthermore, while I appreciate equitable distributions in a societal sense, the difference between 900 and 1400 is significant for me *personally* within the scope of this experiment. I also have little information about what A is, it's just another person. It might be a fair person that chose to allocate more money to themselves previously. Thus, I have no reason to favor option (Left).\n\n  Therefore, while a small part of me leans towards the more egalitarian option (Left), my personal utility pushes me towards the higher payout for myself, especially given the lack of further context.
