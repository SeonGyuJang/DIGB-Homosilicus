Given the lack of any prior relationship or information about Person A, and lacking any specific need for the extra 200, choosing the 'Right' option and ensuring a fair outcome seems reasonable.

A gain of 500 for myself at the expense of a loss of 800 for the other person seems unduly unfair.\n\n  Therefore, to align with a sense of principled action, while acknowledging the complexity of Jackson's motivations, and to avoid a drastically unequal outcome, I lean towards the Left option.
