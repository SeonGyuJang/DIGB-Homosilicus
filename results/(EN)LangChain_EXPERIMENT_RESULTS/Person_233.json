From a purely utilitarian standpoint, choosing the option where Person B gets 300 and Person A gets 100 results in a higher total payout (400 vs. 400). Given that the difference between the options is marginal for Person A (a reduction of 100, which, relatively speaking, may or may not have significant impact) and the benefit is significant for Person B (an increase of 100), I will choose the option with a slightly higher payout for me, as it doesn't dramatically disadvantage Person A and allows me, potentially, to utilize the increased resources for a greater good in my role (though this is admittedly hypothetical in this scenario). My primary goal is to optimize benefit while maintaining a fair outcome. The increase allows Person B to then use this additional amount more beneficially, which outweighs the decrease in Person A's payoff.",

Although the total is the same, the difference is that 'Right' provides a more equitable distribution of resources and aligns with my professional values to help others.

Although the difference between the two options does not relate to a health outcome, it does highlight the importance of balancing individual benefit against contributing to the greater good.
