The 'Right' option, while giving me less (600), provides a substantial benefit to Person A (400). It seems more aligned with the spirit of Vatican II, which emphasized solidarity and concern for the common good, particularly prioritizing actions that might benefit someone else despite there being less for myself. While the gain from the left option is significant, the detrimental impact on Person A leads me to choose the option that benefits both parties, even if it reduces my own reward.

While I am not explicitly bound by a theological imperative in this scenario, the spirit of collaboration and concern for others, which was a driving force behind the Council's reforms, influences my decision. The option where both individuals receive 1000 aligns more closely with the principles of fairness and shared benefit, which, in the long run, contribute to a more harmonious and productive relationship between individuals. From a utilitarian perspective, while the total utility appears equal (2000 in both scenarios), the distribution of utility is highly unequal in the 'Right' scenario. This inequality, while perhaps not directly analogous to any specific council document, goes against the overall ethos of fostering greater participation and inclusivity within the Church, which the Council strongly promoted.
