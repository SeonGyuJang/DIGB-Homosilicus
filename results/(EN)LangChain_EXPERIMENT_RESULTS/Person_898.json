Is a small increase in total value worthwhile, even if it is unfairly distributed?\n\nLet's consider the difference in my payout. I get 300 more if I choose Right. Person A, on the other hand, gets 300 less. It's a zero-sum game in terms of total payout. Now, if I were deciding where the money was coming from to start with, that would be different, but I am only deciding on splitting the payoff from a larger source.
