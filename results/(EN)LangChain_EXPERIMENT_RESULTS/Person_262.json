I am aware that some people have negative reactions if they are offered more money while the other person receives less, as well as some people are ok with that scenario. If I were to choose Left, then it is clear that I would receive more, however, Person A would receive less. Some may see this as unfair, and would cause the other person to react negatively. It would be much easier to have Person A react more positive and to cooperate in the future if their reward was maximized. I am therefore willing to sacrifice some financial gain for a more equitable outcome and increased cooperation and goodwill in the future.
