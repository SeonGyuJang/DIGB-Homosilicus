Person A receiving nothing is unfortunate, but from a utilitarian perspective, my increased influence with 600 outweighs the benefit to them of receiving 400, and me receiving less. It's a tough decision, but I believe the potential public health benefits of choosing the Left option are greater. Additionally, even with person A getting 0 in this single interaction, I hope to use the increased funding to create awareness and access to healthcare that will benefit everyone, including person A, in the long run.

A payoff of 100 seems inadequate and potentially unfair. I believe that research and surveillance for gonorrhea rely on collaboration and trust, and situations perceived as grossly unfair could undermine that. While I'm not suggesting that a small sum like this affects research directly, I believe choosing the equal, higher overall payoff (900 each) reflects a value system that aligns with the collaborative nature of my profession.
