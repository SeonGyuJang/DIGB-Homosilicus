Although self-interest might suggest choosing Right, a security mindset also considers the broader implications of actions. Consistently prioritizing personal gain over fairness can erode trust and cooperation, which are crucial in many aspects of life and even in collaborative security efforts (e.g., information sharing about vulnerabilities). While it's a hypothetical scenario, maintaining a sense of fairness, even in an isolated instance, aligns better with professional ethics and general principles of collaboration.

The difference of 100 is not considered significant enough to outweigh my self-interest, especially in an anonymous and abstract context like this experiment. I am not being explicitly unfair or detrimental to Person A, and my personal gain outweighs the slight decrease in their outcome.
