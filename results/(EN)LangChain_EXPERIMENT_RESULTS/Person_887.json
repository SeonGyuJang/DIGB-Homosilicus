Person A receives twice the amount I do and, more importantly, obtains a substantial gain while I get nothing. If it were just an incremental difference, I wouldn't worry so much.

I see this experiment not only as a test of social preferences, but as a way to study the tendency of people to value fairness/equity above all else.
