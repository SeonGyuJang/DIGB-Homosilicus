While my engineering instincts might initially lean towards maximizing output (my personal gain in this case), my professional values and understanding of broader impacts compel me to consider fairness. The increase in my personal gain from 500 to 800 feels less significant when considering the considerable reduction for person A, and a situation with better outcomes for everybody is preferable.
