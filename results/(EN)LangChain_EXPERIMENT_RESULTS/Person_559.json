I'm not driven by personal monetary gain in this experiment, but rather by making a decision that aligns with what I might observe in nature. I hypothesize that under certain environmental pressures or when resource availability is scarce, redback spiders may prioritize immediate survival, even if that means depriving others of resources.

The 'Right' option provides a higher pay-off for the other person (Person A), but a lower return for me. This might represent cooperation or allowing another access to a limited resource. Without knowing any details about Person A, there isn't a specific evolutionary reason to sacrifice my payout. Since I don't know if Person A 'needs' the resources more, or that any social interaction would lead to a more complex outcome like is typical in spider behaviour (ie: whether Person A may later reciprocate a favor, or would become a competitor etc), I will lean towards the choice that gives me the most resources.\n",
