A fair distribution, even if it means less personal gain, aligns better with the values I admire in Joshua and Caleb.

The choice presented mirrors this tension: pure self-interest (Left) versus a minimal amount of sharing and potential building of trust (Right). While the self-interest option guarantees a larger personal gain, the alternative allows Person A to also benefit, possibly mirroring the idea that the Israelite people function best when trusting one another. However, the historian in me sees the consequences of both trust and distrust within the Bible. Pure self-interest may not be the *best* option, but it is the only guarantee. In this hypothetical and without any previous encounters with Person A, I find myself defaulting to ensuring my own gain is maximized, particularly considering the uncertainty involved.

Option 'Right' offers a more balanced outcome. Although my personal reward is less (600), Person A benefits significantly (400), and the overall outcome is more positive. While I'm not facing giants or fortified cities here, the principle of prioritizing mutual benefit aligns with the positive example of Joshua and Caleb, who displayed faith and recognized the shared potential for success.

Although the analogy isn't perfect as Person A isn't exactly God, in the same way that the Israelite people were asked to trust in God's plan to deliver them to the promised land, the situation has the similar essence where I must decide between faith/trust versus personal benefit.
