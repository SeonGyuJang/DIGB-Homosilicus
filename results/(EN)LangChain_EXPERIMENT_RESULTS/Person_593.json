While it doesn't provide the *largest* absolute gain, the relatively small trade-off in my personal gain (100 points) seems worth it to ensure Person A receives a reasonable allocation. The extra 100 to me is negligible, and fairness is important. This is particularly true given the general societal need to fairly distribute healthcare resources and promote preventative measures against diseases like skin cancer. While I could conceivably *use* the extra 100, the ethical weight of fair distribution in healthcare nudges me towards the Left choice.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the option that provides a more equal distribution, aligning with my professional values and concern for equitable resource allocation.
