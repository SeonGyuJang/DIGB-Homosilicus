Choosing solely based on maximizing my own immediate financial gain feels somewhat disconnected from my professional values.

Given that I am also a researcher and have some sense for that other researchers also contribute to scientific advancement. Choosing option (Right) represents a fairer allocation, where the other participant benefits more, even if I receive slightly less. This would be beneficial in promoting an environment with better conditions for researchers, which could lead to benefits for society. If I were in urgent need for funds or otherwise there might be a reason to act for financial self-interest. In this hypothetical situation there is no indication of such condition.

The first choice is purely self-serving, leaving Person A with nothing. The second choice sacrifices some of my potential gain to provide Person A with a significant benefit. While 400 might not seem like much, the principle of sharing, even minimally, aligns with the collaborative nature of scientific research and the interconnectedness I observe within marine ecosystems.
