Hug Point showcases the dynamism of the natural world, where even the most imposing basalt flows interact with softer sediments, creating something unique. Choosing the 'Right' option, while giving me less directly, fosters a relationship - a small 'interaction' - that aligns more with my scientific sensibilities.
