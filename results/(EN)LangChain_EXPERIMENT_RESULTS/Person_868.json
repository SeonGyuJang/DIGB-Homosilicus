From a purely self-interested perspective, option Right is optimal as it gives me 1500 compared to 1000 in option Left. However, the stark inequality introduced by option Right is troubling. The concept of a 'rank function' in matroid theory, central to my research, inherently considers the dependencies and relationships within a set. Similarly, I can see this situation as an abstract set and the utility gained as an element within it. Choosing option Right introduces a strong dependency: my gain comes at the complete expense of Person A. The submodular property of matroid rank functions implies that adding an element to a smaller set yields a larger increase in rank than adding it to a larger set. In this context, giving Person A nothing is a significant detriment. Moreover, the lack of any 'base' for Person A in option Right makes it structurally less desirable. I also appreciate the beauty and elegance of symmetry. Option Left, where both players receive the same amount, embodies this symmetry. While I could benefit more from option Right, the ethical and structural considerations, coupled with my preference for a fair and balanced outcome, ultimately outweigh the purely self-interested motivation.
