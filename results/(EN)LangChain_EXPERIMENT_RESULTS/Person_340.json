Furthermore, while my research often involves examining social dynamics, this particular situation is unlikely to have any meaningful impact on my ability to access research materials or publish my findings. A 50% increase (200 to 300) in my share would significantly help me fund my research, attend academic conferences, or purchase necessary books and resources.

The theatre itself is a shared experience, and its success depends on the collective involvement of actors, audiences, and patrons. The difference of 400 is not insignificant, and while I could rationalize taking the larger share for my own research resources (books, travel to archives), the principle of sharing, even minimally, aligns more closely with the values that inform my scholarly work.
