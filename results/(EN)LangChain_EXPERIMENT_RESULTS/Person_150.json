The American experiment, from its inception, has been a constant negotiation between individual liberty and the common good. While I understand the historical context in which this decision exists, a constitutional scholar is also aware of the importance of precedent. Choosing (Left) does not set a precedent that can be used to further selfish desires and outcomes, whereas choosing (Right) can. Thus, while my immediate impulse might be to choose the option with the higher payout for myself, ultimately, I believe a fairer distribution (where both parties receive an equal amount) is more aligned with the spirit of compromise and the pursuit of a more just society.

The experiment isolates this choice, removing the broader context of constitutional principles and societal impact that normally colors my thinking.\n\n  While some may argue for maximizing individual gain, this purely economic perspective overlooks the potential for building trust and demonstrating a willingness to share, even in an artificial environment.

The historical debates over secession often hinged on the perceived tyranny of a majority oppressing a minority, or the economic exploitation of one region by another. While this experiment's distribution of money is a far cry from the complexities of political and economic oppression, the significant disparity in payouts echoes those historical concerns.
