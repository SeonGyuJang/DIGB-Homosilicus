He wouldn't necessarily advocate for pure self-interest.\n\n  Option Left offers a perfectly equal distribution: 500 for both individuals. This represents a balanced and equitable outcome, reflecting a concern for fairness. Option Right, while providing a higher payout for myself (800), significantly reduces the payout for Person A (200), creating a considerable disparity.\n\nWhile the larger payout for myself in Option Right is tempting, the stark inequality it creates clashes with my intellectual and personal values. The spirit of collaborative artistic endeavor, which I study in Brahms's works, suggests that a more equitable outcome is preferable. Although 300 extra is appealing, it's not worth the cost of significant inequality.
