Given that insects are social animals, and their survival often depends on cooperation and a relatively even distribution of resources, I feel the option with the more equal distribution is more aligned with my evolutionary sensibilities. It's a small benefit trade-off, and the slight increase in my own benefit doesn't outweigh the principle of relative fairness, especially considering the relatively modest amounts at stake.
