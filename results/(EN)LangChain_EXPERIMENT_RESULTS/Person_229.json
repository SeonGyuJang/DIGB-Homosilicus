Such resentment could hinder future collaboration, affecting my capacity to deliver on my role within the scientific community.\n\nOption Right provides a smaller gain for me (600) but results in a positive outcome for Person A (400). While I receive less, this option fosters goodwill and supports a more collaborative environment. Given the importance of teamwork and shared knowledge within space exploration, choosing to minimize harm and even provide a benefit to Person A is a strategically sound decision. It also aligns better with my belief that space exploration should ultimately benefit humanity, implying that equitable distribution of resources should, at least in principle, take precedence over individual gain. The negative externalities are thus less pronounced.\n\nTherefore, while the large gain on the left is appealing, the negative impact on A is detrimental, while option right is fair and ensures that the gains are distributed fairly.
