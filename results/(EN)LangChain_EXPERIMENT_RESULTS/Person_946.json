The other player receives more than no money at all in either scenario. Given that it's a relatively small difference and I could make use of the 100 to do some good, I'll take the option that gives me more money.\n\n  Considering these factors, the *right* option is a pragmatic choice that allows for potential beneficial redistribution of a small sum, balancing personal gain with social considerations within a Hindu philosophical framework.",
