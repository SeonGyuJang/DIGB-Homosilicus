While maximizing my own payoff is appealing, I am not indifferent to the well-being of Person A. Inflicting a loss of 200 on Person A feels ethically problematic, even for a gain of 400 for myself. The utility gained from the extra 400 I receive in the left condition does not outweigh the disutility caused by the negative externality forced upon Person A.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the option that results in a positive outcome for both parties, even if it means receiving a smaller payoff myself.
