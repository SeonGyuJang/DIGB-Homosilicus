The 'Right' option, while giving me a smaller amount (600), provides Person A with 400. This, in my view, represents a minimal sharing that reflects a sense of fairness and collaboration. Considering that this is a social preference experiment, choosing the 'Right' option allows both 'learners' (in a broader sense, as we both gain something) to benefit. My experience tells me that fostering collaboration and a sense of fairness often leads to better outcomes in the long run, even if it means foregoing a purely selfish advantage in the short term. From a vocabulary perspective, it is better to have two people with 400 words than just one person with 1000 words and one without.
