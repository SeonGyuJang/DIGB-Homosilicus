While I personally benefit more in that scenario, I believe that a more equitable distribution, where both Person A and I receive 400, is preferable. My work focuses on highlighting the diverse and often marginalized indigenous communities within Mexico, and this requires a commitment to fairness and a rejection of systems that disproportionately benefit some at the expense of others.
