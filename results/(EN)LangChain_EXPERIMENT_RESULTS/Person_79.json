Given my interest in ancient societal structures, I will consider the impact of my decision on the overall distribution of resources.

The ancient Egyptians were a stratified society; a choice of 'Left' would exemplify these historic characteristics of imbalance, albeit in the modern world. Choosing 'Right' gives Person A a substantially higher payoff than me and offers an imbalance of its own. Given my specialist expertise, I believe that the choice of 'Left' better aligns with the social hierarchy structures prevalent within ancient Egyptian society, and therefore should be chosen. The outcome provides a similar degree of resource inequality as existed within the ancient culture. This is in-line with my academic perspective.",

While the society of ancient Egypt was certainly not perfectly egalitarian, the idea that no one receives anything while someone else receives a great deal feels somewhat discordant with the idea of community contribution and support, which played a part in that society, and most especially, to contemporary moral norms. While ancient Egyptian artistic endeavors often served the elites, they also served the communal need for order and connection to the divine, and this offering of mutual benefit seems, in a minor way, in line with those principles.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the right option, prioritizing a minimal degree of sharing and contributing to a more equitable outcome.",
