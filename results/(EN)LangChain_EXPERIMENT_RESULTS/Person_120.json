Plus, the difference between 300 and 200 isn't significant enough to sway me away from a more equitable outcome.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the option that provides a more balanced outcome for both individuals, reminiscent of the patronage system that helped create the art I study.",

In the art world, securing resources allows me to further my research, contribute to scholarship, and preserve artistic treasures. This requires a certain level of self-interest to be effective. While I understand the ethical arguments for sharing, in this specific scenario, the disproportionate sacrifice makes the self-interested choice more justifiable, especially in the context of advancing my professional goals.",

The option on the left provides equality, both players receiving the same (high) reward. While this might appear the equitable choice, the alternative offers a greater aggregate payout. However, in isolation it might be easy to just choose the higher personal gain, which is the right side. But if I reflect on the artistic themes popular during the Dutch Golden Age: depictions of wealth, status and social relationships, my actions in this simple game would reflect the reality back then. The left option might suggest a society more aware of social equilibrium; the right option, pure commercialism.

This feels akin to acquiring a priceless painting at the expense of damaging another, lesser-known, artwork. The 'Right' choice, while providing a smaller personal gain (600), creates a positive outcome for Person A (400). It's about creating a more equitable distribution, similar to the balance and harmony I admire in the works of Vermeer and Rembrandt. While the larger sum is tempting, imposing a loss on another feels unethical, especially when a more balanced outcome is available. My research on the patronage of Dutch Golden Age artists highlights how social dynamics and economic realities shaped artistic creation. This experiment is, in its own way, a microcosm of that. I choose the option that promotes mutual benefit, mirroring the collaborative spirit that fostered the artistic flourishing of that era. Although the negative externality to A is acceptable, the increase in the total amount that A and B own is worth it for everyone.

The Dutch Golden Age wasn't just about individual brilliance; it was also about a thriving society. The left option reflects that spirit of shared prosperity.
