The spirit of the Marosszék dances, the stories they tell, and the values they represent often emphasize collaboration and shared prosperity.

It's not a situation where I'm drastically depriving the other person of resources. The additional 100 for myself could be used to acquire valuable research materials – perhaps rare transcriptions of Marosszék melodies or books detailing the cultural context of these dances. These resources would ultimately contribute to my research and preservation efforts, benefitting the wider understanding of Hungarian folk culture.\n\n  Given the small magnitude of the trade-off and the potential use of the extra funds for research directly related to my passion (Hungarian folk music preservation), I believe choosing the option that benefits me slightly more aligns with my overall goals.
