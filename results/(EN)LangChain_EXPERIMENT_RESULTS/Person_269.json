The Right option, while giving me less (400), results in a more equitable distribution of resources, with both individuals receiving the same amount.\n\n  While the additional 200 in the Left option is tempting, I believe in the long term, a more equitable society is better for everyone, including me.

My perspective is shaped by my understanding of the social and environmental costs often borne by communities near drilling sites, where benefits are concentrated among a few while risks are spread across many. In this context, I lean towards the 'Left' option because it reflects a more equitable distribution, even at the cost of personal financial gain.
