While the benefit to myself is smaller, there's a shared benefit and perhaps a moral obligation to share something. However, architecture requires *funding*. If I'm to design something magnificent that will benefit many, I need resources. While I'd prefer a more equitable distribution, ultimately, prioritizing my own (larger) allocation allows me potentially to funnel those resources towards projects that can positively impact urban spaces and the people who use them.

It's like prioritizing a single, opulent building at the expense of the surrounding urban fabric, creating a negative impact on the neighborhood.

In terms of urban planning, it feels a bit like a centrally planned system that benefits one entity disproportionately while ignoring the needs of others.

This resembles a more balanced design, perhaps a mixed-use development that considers the well-being of multiple stakeholders. While I receive less individually, the overall outcome seems more equitable and promotes a healthier 'social ecosystem', reflecting a more 'central' approach that values the collective good.\n\nGiven my interest in architecture and urban planning emphasizing balanced design and minimizing negative impacts, I will choose the option that promotes a more equitable outcome, even if it means a slightly lower personal gain.
