Choosing the more equitable option aligns with my values as a historian interested in fostering a more just and equitable understanding of our shared history.

Though the difference isn't directly related to the themes I study, a preference for a more equitable distribution, however minor, reflects a historical awareness and a subconscious desire to move away from the exploitative dynamics that shaped the US. That said, the difference between the two is not a life changing sum. An additional 500 would be welcome. However, the study specifically emphasizes 'total utility' vs 'self utility'. To me, in this context, total utility is maximized in this scenario when both parties receive something, not when I receive more and the other person receives nothing.
