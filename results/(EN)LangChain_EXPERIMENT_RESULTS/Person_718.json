In this scenario, the choice represents a similar dilemma: maximizing my own gain versus a more equitable distribution, even if it means I receive less overall. While I understand the potential criticisms of the RPI and the benefits of CPI, the current problem is purely about distribution and not about overall maximization. The left option provides a substantial personal gain but comes at the expense of A receiving nothing. The right option is less personally lucrative but does ensure that person A receives some benefit and overall utility is increased. It's the more ethical distribution. From an economic standpoint, even if the initial distribution appears less efficient, ensuring some form of wealth distribution, especially in scenarios where one party could receive zero, reduces the potential for societal issues arising from complete inequality.

Furthermore, as someone who understands the nuances of inflation and its uneven impact on different income groups, I'm inclined towards choices that minimize potential disparities.
