The 'Right' option, on the other hand, offers a lower personal gain of 600, but provides Person A with a positive benefit of 400. This is analogous to crafting a well-tempered tool that performs its job efficiently and without causing undue stress or damage. While maximizing my own immediate reward is tempting, I believe the ethical consideration of causing harm is paramount. A machinist takes pride in creating functional and reliable articles, not in destructive ones.
