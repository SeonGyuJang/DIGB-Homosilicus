Furthermore, 200 isn't an insignificant amount for Person A; it's not zero. It represents a contribution or acknowledgement, even if not equal.\n\nConsidering these competing values – fairness versus personal gain – the larger amount offered by 'Right' sways my decision slightly. I'm not denying the value of equality (like a good rhythm section), but the increased personal benefit, while still providing some value to Person A, is attractive. Ultimately, while the difference isn't vast, the allure of the larger reward aligns better with a balanced view where self-interest plays a role.",
