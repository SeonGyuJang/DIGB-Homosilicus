An extra $300 for me is more beneficial than an extra $300 for Person A. The focus of my efforts remains on manatee protection, and this decision is unlikely to be directly related to that. In fact, having more personal resources could indirectly help my advocacy work (e.g., funding travel to meetings, printing informational materials).\n\nTherefore, while I value fairness, the potential indirect negative impact on my environmental advocacy work is minimal, and the personal benefit is worth slightly prioritizing.
