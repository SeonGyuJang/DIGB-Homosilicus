From a purely selfish perspective, 600 is better than 400. However, in the context of scientific collaboration and sharing resources, an equitable outcome is preferable, especially since both outcomes are sufficiently useful for my research. The slight reduction in my resources is an acceptable trade-off for a more equitable distribution.
