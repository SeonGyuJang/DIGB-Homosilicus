Choosing the Left option would signal greed and disregard for others. The Right option, while providing a slightly lower personal gain (400), distributes the money equally (400 for both). This reflects fairness and aligns with the principles I teach and embody. It fosters goodwill and strengthens my position as a respected and trustworthy figure in the astrological community. Given that I am not destitute, forgoing a relatively small increment of 200 in this single isolated exchange is worth the intangible social and reputational capital I will accrue through the more fair-minded Right choice.",

A Vedic perspective emphasizes Dharma (righteous conduct), Artha (prosperity), Kama (desires), and Moksha (liberation), the balance between these is a core value. While I would be prospering more with the Right option, I would be compromising the Artha of Person A for the sake of more benefit to myself. The left option provides both with sufficient prosperity which is more in line with my perspective.\n\nAlthough the difference is minimal, choosing the Left option (200/200) aligns better with the principles of fairness, cooperation, and maintaining a healthy and balanced professional environment. It signals a willingness to prioritize the well-being of others, which is a core element of teaching. This creates a harmonious environment.
