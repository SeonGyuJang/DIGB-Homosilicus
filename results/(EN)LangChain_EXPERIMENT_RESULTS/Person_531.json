The difference of 200 between 300 and 100 is significant, which is a relative loss. The equal split offered by the 'Left' option, although providing me with a lower absolute gain, fosters a sense of fairness and social cohesion. While some would advocate for maximizing individual gain, my professional and personal values favor a more equitable distribution. I'll lean into the background of my experience in tax law and my understanding of social benefits from a utilitarian view and go with the even distribution.
