These communities often understood that collective well-being contributed to individual flourishing. The discovery of St Nicholas's relics, with its potential impact on faith and the establishment of the priory, shows that communities can prosper through a shared belief of helping others. Although St Nicholas's life may not precisely align with Trinitarian tenants, both share an emphasis on community well-being and collective prosperity.\n\n  Furthermore, standing here amidst the ruins of Cross Kirk, a place that once fostered community and spiritual growth before the Reformation, makes the concept of fairness even more palpable. The Reformation highlights the impact of self-interest and change on the social fabric.
