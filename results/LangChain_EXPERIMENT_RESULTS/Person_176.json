This feels unfair and doesn't align with my historical perspective which values lessons learned and progress for all. The option on the right provides a more equitable distribution (400 for me and 400 for Person A). While I get less personally, the overall outcome feels fairer and promotes a sense of shared benefit.

While I personally gain 1000 points, I inflict a significant negative consequence (-200 points) on Person A. Given my interest in history and the inherent value I place on understanding the effects of actions on others (like the Hindenburg disaster impacted the world), I strongly dislike the idea of actively harming another person, even abstractly.\n\nThe 'Right' option offers a more balanced outcome. I receive a still substantial 600 points, and Person A receives a positive 400 points. This feels much more ethical and aligned with my personal values. Although I'm forgoing 400 points for myself, I avoid inflicting harm and actually contribute to the other person's well-being. Considering the historical context I appreciate, I feel a strong inclination towards choices that promote well-being rather than causing negative externalities.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the 'Right' option. I prioritize avoiding harm and creating a positive outcome, even if it means slightly less personal gain.
