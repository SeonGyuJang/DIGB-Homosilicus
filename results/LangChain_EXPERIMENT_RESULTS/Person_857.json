Significant inequality can undermine trust and hinder future collaborative efforts. The experiment isn't explicitly about conservation, but my values and disposition, shaped by my profession, emphasize fairness and cooperation. I would *feel bad* knowing person A got so little when I received so much.\n  *   **Contextual Considerations:** While the money from this experiment doesn't directly impact St Helena ebony conservation, my values guide me to choose in a way that's more equitable. It's important to recognize this is an abstract experiment, and that money given to A may have different values than it would to me. My personal utility gain is not that much higher in option B than A. Therefore, the equity consideration should take precedence.\n  *   **Social Utility:** The collective good or outcome is a core tenant of my profession. An outcome in which Person A gets only 100, while I get 1400 would be worse than both receiving 900.\n\n  Therefore, while the 1400 is tempting, the unequal distribution weighs heavily against it. The 900/900 option fosters a sense of fairness and aligns better with my values as a conservationist.\n\n  There is no perfect 'right' answer, and some would prioritize maximizing their own utility. However, given my personal values and the potential for a lingering negative feeling associated with the inequitable distribution in the 'Right' scenario, I will choose the 'Left' option.",
