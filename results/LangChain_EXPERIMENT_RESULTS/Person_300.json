As a conservationist, I am already driven by internal motivation and a feeling of doing something good, so choosing \"Left\" would align better with my intrinsic values and satisfaction. \n\nTherefore, although the 'Right' option yields a larger sum for myself, the inherent unfairness and potential damage to collaborative relationships outweigh the monetary gain.
