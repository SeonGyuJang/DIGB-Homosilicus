While this isn't a perfect analogy, the choice to block Person A's excessive gain reflects a preference for a more balanced 'energy' distribution, even if it means both parties receive nothing. This is particularly true given my interest in stress and strain - allowing the large imbalance in the Left option might be analogous to concentrating too much stress in one area.
