Even Isaac Allerton, despite his initial struggles and perceived waywardness, ultimately contributed to Virginia's society.\n\n  The choice here reflects a tension between maximizing my own immediate gain and achieving a more balanced outcome. While receiving 600 feels appealing in the short term, leaving Person A with nothing seems inherently unfair. It's the kind of disparity that could lead to resentment and social instability – something my historical studies have shown me time and again. The 'right' choice, offering a more equitable split (400 for both), aligns better with my sense of justice and what I believe contributes to a more harmonious and sustainable society, even on a small scale. It echoes the social responsibility that guided many of the prominent Virginia families I study. While Allerton was looking out for Allerton, the F.F.V. were building Virginia.\n\n  It is also worth noting that an extra 200 is a relatively trivial amount of money, so the trade-off of an extra 200 for a more fair outcome is worth the cost, particularly from a philosophical and ethical standpoint. As a historian, the importance of a legacy of fairness also weighs heavily. Taking 600 while the other party receives 0 is not something I would be proud of.",

While egalitarianism is a nice sentiment, the real world rarely works that way, and historical figures, even those in the families I study, frequently pursued personal advancement. A 100 unit difference in my favor feels consistent with that history.\n\nBesides, even Isaac Allerton, the sometimes-wayward Pilgrim who found success in Virginia, wasn't afraid to make choices that benefited him.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the option that benefits me more.",
