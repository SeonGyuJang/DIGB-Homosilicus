Although I'm not intrinsically biased towards altruism, the difference in perceived fairness makes me a bit uncomfortable.\n\n  Considering my professional background in fluid mechanics, I can draw an analogy. In fluid dynamics, sudden and drastic changes in parameters (like pressure or flow rate) can create instability and inefficiency within a system. Similarly, a large disparity in payoff between individuals can potentially lead to resentment or dissatisfaction within a social 'system'.
