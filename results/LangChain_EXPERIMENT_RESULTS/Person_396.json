Observing how others react in situations like these provides insights into human behavior, which I find intellectually stimulating.

In the grand scheme of things, probably not. My own payoff of 500 is a tangible benefit, even if Person A receives more. Choosing 'Right' provides neither of us with any data points. Choosing 'Left' at least provides *me* with some benefit, funding perhaps for some small lab supplies, and doesn't negatively impact the other person beyond a theoretical perceived inequality. Therefore, I'll choose 'Left'. While I'm aware of the experiment's intention to gauge my reaction to inequality, my own direct benefit wins out. The zeros in 'Right' are essentially a black box.
