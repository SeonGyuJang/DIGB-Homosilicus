Paul Nelson's arguments about the non-randomness of biological design and the limitations of purely materialistic explanations for the origin of life resonate in the back of my mind. If there were some underlying design principle, it might lean towards promoting cooperation and fairness.\n\nUltimately, however, I will choose the option that gives me more, which is consistent with what I can imagine occurs in natural selection, where organisms primarily serve their own interests in their attempts to survive and reproduce.
