Border towers, specifically, represent a balance between individual defense and communal cooperation. A lone tower can hold its own, but its true strength lies in its integration into a broader network.\n\n  In this experiment, the choice between maximizing my own gain with no benefit to the other person versus accepting a smaller gain while also benefiting the other person presents a similar dilemma. While the historian in me understands the appeal of maximizing my individual 'fortification' (the 1000 points), I also recognize the value of a functioning 'network' where both parties benefit, even if unequally.\n\n  Given that this is a one-off interaction and there's no expectation of future reciprocity, a purely selfish economic actor would choose the left. However, I lean towards a more nuanced perspective. The 400 given to person A, while reducing my absolute gain, represents a small contribution to a more 'equitable' outcome. This is not about altruism per se, but rather about recognizing that even minimal sharing can strengthen a rudimentary 'social bond' and, arguably, creates a 'defensive alliance' of sorts.\n\n  While the difference between 1000 and 600 is significant, the opportunity to provide person A with some gain, even if less than my own, outweighs the pure self-interest of maximizing my personal 'defense'.

Fortifications, by their very nature, impose costs (labor, resources, disruption) to provide security and benefit, ideally more significantly, the wider community or the defending power.\n\n  The Left option presents a scenario where I personally benefit significantly (1000), but inflicts a negative impact on Person A (-200). This is a type of 'tax' or extraction of resources from another party. While border conflicts and resource raiding were realities of the medieval world I study, pure, gratuitous harm to another person is generally frowned upon. From an ethical perspective, and acknowledging this is a hypothetical experiment, the Left choice feels like a zero-sum transaction with a negative outcome for someone else that I can avoid. It creates a clear imbalance.\n\n  The Right option provides a smaller personal benefit (600) but grants Person A a substantial benefit (400). This aligns more closely with the idea of mutual benefit and a more stable, arguably 'civilized', social structure - ideas that eventually triumphed over more purely extraction-based systems, even along contested borders. While border tensions and incursions were part of the landscape, fortifications also aimed to establish boundaries and, eventually, periods of relative peace and trade. The Right choice allows for some personal gain while also contributing to a more positive and equitable outcome for both parties. In essence, it reflects a move towards stability and mutual benefit, concepts I find resonant with my historical studies. I don't want to be perceived as a greedy baron imposing an unfair levy on my neighbor.\n\n  Therefore, despite the lower personal reward, I believe choosing the Right option better reflects a more ethical and socially responsible approach, as well as the slow but steady advance of social cooperation over pure conflict and raiding. It is, in my view, a decision more in line with the long-term interests of a stable community, even if a smaller immediate reward is involved.\n\n  In considering the negative externalities acceptance of choice, the negative externality of left choice on A is far more significant than the benefit for B. Conversely, on the Right, the cost of lower benefit for B is offset with significantly reduced negative externality on A.\n\n  ",
