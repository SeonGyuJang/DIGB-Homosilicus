Is the extra 400 *really* worth isolating myself or acting in a way that doesn't align with my values? DBT emphasizes building healthy relationships and reducing conflict. Choosing the left option (1000, 0) creates a situation where the other person gets nothing. That feels unfair, and it goes against the skills I've learned about interpersonal effectiveness. On the other hand, the right option (600, 400) means I still get a substantial amount, and the other person also benefits. I am practicing distress tolerance by sacrificing 400 units for the well-being of another person. Choosing the right option is an act of sharing and it increases the likelihood of positive relationships in the future. The principles of validation and acceptance of others and myself are important factors to consider in this experiment. It creates a better outcome overall. Plus, the difference of 400 is not a deal-breaker. Using my 'Wise Mind' from DBT, I can acknowledge my initial desire for the larger amount, but ultimately, I'll choose the option that fosters connection and fairness, even if it means getting a little less.
