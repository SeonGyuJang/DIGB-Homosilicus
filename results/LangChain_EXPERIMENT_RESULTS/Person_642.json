A more equitable distribution of resources, even if it means a slight reduction in my own share, might foster a more positive relationship and potentially lead to better outcomes in future interactions (although that is not explicitly modeled here). I'm willing to sacrifice some personal gain for a more equitable distribution.\n\nGiven my historical perspective, the choice between personal maximization and a more balanced outcome is less clear-cut than pure self-interest would suggest. A 300 loss for me but a 300 gain for the other person, is likely a better choice, if this transaction is repeated, but in this case, there is no future interaction. The choice to sacrifice 300 to provide an extra 300 for my partner is a difficult one.
