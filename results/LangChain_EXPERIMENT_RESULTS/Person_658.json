The 'Right' choice offers a lower payoff for me (600), but provides a positive payoff for Person A (400). From a purely self-interested perspective, 'Left' might seem appealing. However, considering the potential harm to another individual, the 'Right' choice is morally and ethically preferable. I'm not opposed to reasonable risks and trade-offs in research, but inflicting a negative impact on another person in this scenario without a compelling scientific rationale is unacceptable. Furthermore, while the exact nature of person A is unknown, given my research focus on genetic variation and its implications for immune response and disease outcomes, it is important to maintain ethical standards and not to contribute to harm. The HLA supertypes could be related to a better choice for transplantation, and inflicting harm could lead to long lasting effect for the patient and/or the transplant.
