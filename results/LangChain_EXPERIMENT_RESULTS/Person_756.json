Denying the other person anything, as in the Left option, seems a bit cruel. In Tolkien's works, even characters with seemingly irredeemable pasts often find avenues for redemption, often facilitated by the kindness of others. To deny someone anything at all seems against the idea of offering hope and redemption through the opportunity of some reward. The right option, where both Person A and B receive 400, embodies a spirit of equity and partnership, aligning with the values I cherish. This option reflects a more equitable distribution, even if it means foregoing a slightly larger personal gain.

Redemption through suffering, a recurring motif in Tolkien's narratives, suggests that sacrificing personal comfort for the benefit of others can lead to a greater good. The Right option (400 for me, 600 for A) embodies this ideal. Though it entails a personal loss of 300, it grants Person A a significantly larger share, reflecting a more equitable distribution and fostering a sense of fellowship. This aligns with the values of selfless sacrifice exemplified by characters like Frodo and Sam. While practicality often necessitates difficult choices, in this simplified scenario, the opportunity to improve another's well-being outweighs the allure of marginal personal gain. The power of hope, the belief in a better future, is sustained by acts of kindness and generosity. Choosing the Right option, therefore, feels not only ethically sound but also consistent with the profound lessons embedded in the literature I cherish.",

The Middle-earth narrative emphasizes the importance of fellowship and mutual support, and the disastrous consequences of selfishness. Choosing the option where I receive less (600) but the other person receives something substantial (400) embodies the spirit of these values. It's a small act of solidarity, a recognition of our shared humanity, and a rejection of the idea that one person's gain must come at another's expense.\n\nThe difference in personal gain is minimal compared to the increase in overall well-being and the upholding of important moral principles.
