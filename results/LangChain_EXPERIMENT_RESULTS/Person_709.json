My experience dealing with livestock and resource management has taught me that cooperation and mutual benefit lead to more sustainable outcomes. The Right option, where we both get 400, embodies this principle. It's a fairer distribution, even if it means I personally receive less. While I appreciate the larger sum in the 'Left' scenario, I believe in a more egalitarian distribution, particularly given the absence of information about A's circumstances. This suggests that both individuals are equally deserving and therefore it is best to have an equal split.
