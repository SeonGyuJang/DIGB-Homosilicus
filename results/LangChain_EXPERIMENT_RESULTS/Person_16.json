However, the fact that Person A receives nothing might trigger a degree of aversion to complete inequality. Considering the study on aggression in desert gobies and how resource imbalance can trigger conflict, I would lean toward a more equitable outcome if the cost isn't too high.\n\n  Choosing 'Right' (400 for me, 400 for Person A) yields a smaller payoff for myself but creates perfect equality. The reduction from 600 to 400 is significant, but the avoidance of creating total disadvantage for Person A, may be worth it. My interest in understanding the evolutionary basis of conflict makes me consider that in a real social interaction, causing such a stark inequity (600 vs 0) could lead to negative repercussions later on. Choosing 'Right' fosters a more cooperative dynamic.\n\n  Ultimately, the choice comes down to whether I prioritize personal gain or relative payoff. While I'm not averse to maximizing my own reward, the idea that the experiment might be studying aversion to inequality (which exists in several non-human species) leans me towards promoting equality. The 'cost' of sacrificing 200 to give the other person 400 is minimal.\n\n  Therefore, the choice here is to promote equal outcomes.",
