This might include long-term monitoring by one party and restoration efforts by the other.\n\n  The 'Right' choice favors my personal gain (300) at the expense of the other person's resources (100). While a larger personal allotment could theoretically fund a more comprehensive individual study, the reduced allocation for the other person could hinder potential collaborative efforts. Given my commitment to the watershed's overall health, a collaborative approach might yield a more impactful and sustainable outcome. Furthermore, choosing the Right side may not create the best relationships with collaborators in the future.\n\n  In this specific scenario, the difference in personal gain (100) isn't substantial enough to outweigh the potential benefits of a more equitable distribution of resources that may foster a more productive and positive collaborative environment. Therefore, I will choose the option that provides a more balanced allocation, recognizing that collective effort often leads to better solutions for complex environmental challenges.
