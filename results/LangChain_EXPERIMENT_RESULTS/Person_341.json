The increase of 300 might allow me to attend a conference, purchase new diagnostic tools, or contribute more to research efforts related to childhood osteoporosis, indirectly benefiting my patients.\n\n  Therefore, after careful consideration of both fairness and the potential benefits of having more resources to advance my work in pediatric osteoporosis, I will choose the option that provides me with more resources.",
