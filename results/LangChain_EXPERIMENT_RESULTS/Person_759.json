Option Right, while offering less for myself, allows Person A to receive a substantial benefit. Although I could use the additional 400 to acquire more high-quality bitter orange or invest in better tools for my practice, the feeling of contributing to another person's well-being aligns with the principles of balance and harmony that guide my practice. Furthermore, although 400 may be a 'minimal' share, it's a non-zero share, representing a conscious decision not to leave Person A with nothing. This reflects a degree of social consideration.

Option Right results in Person A getting 400 while I get 600. From a utilitarian perspective, Option Right creates more overall 'value' since it avoids a loss for Person A.
