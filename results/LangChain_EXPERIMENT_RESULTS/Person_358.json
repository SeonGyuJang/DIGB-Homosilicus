It reflects a sense of solidarity and fairness, which aligns with my values and my past struggles for a more just society.

Choosing extreme self-interest feels disconnected from that sensibility. It is a solitary gain that leaves a void. The alternative, though offering less personal gain (600 instead of 1000), contributes to a shared benefit. 400 for Person A creates a small, perhaps insignificant, bond. It acknowledges a shared existence, a fleeting moment of connection. While practicality dictates I could benefit from more, the weight of history and the resonance of shared humanity nudge me towards a choice that, however small, recognizes the other. It mirrors the act of translating – offering something of value to another culture, even if it means sacrificing a direct benefit. Moreover, choosing the 'right' option aligns with the spirit of resistance against oppressive systems, a value I've actively promoted.

My experiences have taught me the importance of solidarity and empathy, especially towards those who are vulnerable. Choosing the right option (600 for me, 400 for A) means foregoing a larger personal gain, but it also avoids inflicting harm. While I value material comfort, I also recognize that inflicting harm would deeply go against the values I fought for when I was advocating for a free Lithuania.
