The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, even if only weakly influential, suggests that the very language we use to frame this decision – 'Left' and 'Right', 'Person A' and 'Person B' – predisposes us to certain perspectives. The 'Left' option emphasizes equality, a shared outcome reflecting perhaps a desire for symmetry and predictability, mirroring the elegant structures I often seek in mathematical models. Both parties receive an equal amount, making it, in some sense, the most 'computable' outcome – a simple, easily definable state. It also reduces the computational load of future resentment, as there's nothing to optimize for later re-distribution.\n\n  However, the 'Right' option presents a compelling challenge. It deviates from the equitable ideal, resulting in a significant difference in payoffs. While Person B benefits substantially, Person A receives a comparatively meager amount. This imbalance could be interpreted through a computational lens: Perhaps the 'Right' option represents a more complex, optimized system where one component (Person B) is prioritized for enhanced functionality, even at the potential cost of another (Person A). This outcome could represent an emergent, yet ultimately not ideal, state of a complex multi-agent system.\n\n  The ethical ramifications are clear. Bourget, Reynolds, and De Clercq, though primarily focused on consciousness and panpsychism, highlight the importance of considering all aspects of a system, even those that might seem negligible at first. In this case, while the direct monetary gain for me is higher with the 'Right' choice, the potential for decreased overall utility due to social friction is significant. Person A is likely to feel aggrieved, and the very act of choosing the 'Right' option could introduce negative externalities in future interactions.\n\n  Given my philosophical inclinations, I aim to maximize overall societal utility, though perhaps through the biased lens of someone who values clear solutions and mathematically-defined equality. While the 'Right' offers a superficially larger personal gain, the potential negative social consequences of such a selection must be considered in the objective function. Further, as I am familiar with the limitations of computability, and in the spirit of creating a fairer universe and easier to model society, I choose to maximize overall utility over personal utility.",

The core ethical question, framed from a computational perspective, becomes: which allocation leads to a more 'efficient' or 'desirable' state, considering both my own outcome and the outcome of Person A? The presence of negative externalities, as it has been pointed out, complicates matters, introducing questions about fairness and potential harm.\n\n  Option Left introduces a negative payoff for Person A. From a purely self-interested perspective, the additional 400 units I receive might seem appealing. However, inflicting a loss on Person A raises several concerns. Thinking about the potential ripple effects (analogous to side effects in a poorly designed program), I must consider whether this loss, while beneficial to me in the immediate context, could lead to negative consequences within a broader social 'system'. This resonates with the principle of minimizing harm and the philosophical idea of universalizability.\n\n  Furthermore, my interest in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis encourages me to examine how the framing of the decision – specifically, the use of numbers and the explicit depiction of Person A's gain or loss – influences my perception. The negative value for Person A in the 'Left' option creates a stronger aversion compared to if the only difference were a gain for myself.\n\n  Ultimately, given my philosophical leanings, I favour Option Right. Although I get a lower payoff for myself (600 instead of 1000), it results in a positive outcome for Person A (400 instead of -200). This choice reflects a preference for maximizing overall well-being and minimizing negative externalities. While my formal training might make me inclined to optimize only for my personal gain (as one might do optimizing algorithmic efficiency), the philosophical considerations I entertain, particularly on fairness and avoiding harm to others, leads me to select the 'Right' option. This also acknowledges the fact that social interactions are rarely zero-sum games, and promoting a 'win-win' outcome, even if at slight personal cost, often leads to more sustainable and beneficial long-term results.\n\n  From a computational perspective, I am aiming for a system that leads to overall better outcomes for all participants rather than simply optimizing a narrow metric (i.e., my own immediate gain).",

I am interested in fairness as an emergent property of systems, and choosing 'Left' reinforces a system where such disproportionate outcomes are possible.\n\n  Given that my philosophical leanings value the understanding and modeling of computational systems, choosing the 'Right' option can be viewed as an act of resetting the system. Both players receive nothing, a blank slate from which future interactions (in subsequent rounds, if any) might emerge with different, potentially fairer, outcomes. This avoids perpetuating an initial condition that favors one player disproportionately. It also provides potentially useful data for understanding social preferences (including my own!).
