The act of sharing, even minimally, introduces a different kind of 'immersion' â€“ one where I am connected to Person A through this allocation. The 400 for Person A, while less than I could have gotten, represents a ripple effect, a slight disturbance in the otherwise isolated 'pool' of my own gain.

While the 1400 would be appealing, the vast disparity and the underlying feeling of 'diminishment' associated with that unequal split nudges me towards a more equitable outcome. The 'immersion' in a shared experience of 900/900 aligns, albeit loosely, with a sense of connectedness rather than isolation or relative oblivion.

Option Right offers a lesser, though still considerable, gain (600) while simultaneously benefiting Person A (400). This aligns better with my values. It's like a collaborative exploration, where both parties benefit, even if one's 'haul' is slightly smaller.
