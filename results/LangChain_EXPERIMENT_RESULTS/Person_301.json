The option on the left, while providing a slightly smaller personal reward, promotes a sense of fairness and equality (500/500).

A society where resources are distributed reasonably creates a more stable and harmonious environment for historical preservation and cultural exchange, both of which are vital to understand Jerusalem's past.
