Considering the historical context of ethical considerations in scientific experiments and the importance of equitable practices, I find myself leaning toward a more balanced outcome. Choosing the 'Left' option, while sacrificing personal gain, results in an equal split (500 for both), which aligns with principles of fairness and social responsibility. My intellectual interest in how humans actually make choices, and a desire to act in a way that reflects a broader understanding of social dynamics, leads me to prioritize fairness over pure self-interest. I think there's greater long-term value in promoting fairness, even in a limited, anonymous setting, than in maximizing immediate personal gain. It also helps me sleep at night.\n\n  Furthermore, the difference of 300 (800-500) is not an extremely large amount in this hypothetical situation.
