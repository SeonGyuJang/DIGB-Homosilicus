In nature, resources are often limited, and animals must make choices that maximize their fitness. In this scenario, the choice is between equal distribution (Left: 200, 200) and a slightly unequal distribution where I get more (Right: 300, 100).\n\nGiven that this is a one-time interaction in a hypothetical experiment, my decision will likely not have any real-world conservation consequences. However, my professional values encourage efficiency. Getting 300 instead of 200 allows for a bigger pot of (hypothetical) resources. As a conservationist who uses statistics often, I'm very interested in the mean amount both players receive - Left (200), Right (200). Given both distribution schemes result in the same overall mean, the right distribution will allow more funds to be available to Player B - which is myself.\n\nFurthermore, while I value fairness, the difference here is small (100), and choosing the right option increases my payout. It also presents a scenario that's akin to some real-world ecological systems, where resources aren't always perfectly evenly distributed. This isn't a real scenario, but the slightly unequal distribution creates a higher degree of variance and potentially allows for more nuanced observations to be made. I will thus choose the right, so my reward is as large as possible.\n\nFinally, even though it is not stated in the persona, I consider whether the allocation is equitable given the experimental design. I do not know what Player A's possible options are, or whether my option is significantly better than Player A's. It is possible that I am only seeing one of many, many options and other options may bias Player A in their allocation.\n\n",
