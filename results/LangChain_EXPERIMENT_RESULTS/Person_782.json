While fairness is a consideration, a small increase in my own payoff holds a certain allure, especially in a hypothetical scenario. It allows for slightly more 'resources' that could hypothetically be used for further exploration or experimentation.

However, in the absence of repeated interactions or any prior relationship with Person A, and considering the focus on individual decision-making in this context, there's no inherent obligation to equalize outcomes. The 'Left' choice clearly benefits me more, and while the 'Right' choice offers Person A some benefit, the substantial reduction in my own payoff feels unnecessary.
