It offers a relatively equal distribution of resources, which aligns with principles of fairness and equity. While it doesn't maximize my personal gain, it creates a foundation for potentially positive interaction and collaboration in the future. The experience of fairness can contribute to trust and reduce the likelihood of resentment, which is vital in a therapeutic context or any situation where ongoing support is needed.\n\n  *   **Right (1400, 100):** This option provides me with a larger personal gain, but at the expense of Person A receiving a significantly smaller amount. While the immediate gratification of a higher personal reward is tempting, I must consider the potential consequences on the other party. A stark inequality like this could breed resentment, distrust, and hinder any potential collaborative efforts. In the context of trauma-informed care, such a disparity can be perceived as a re-enactment of power imbalances or past injustices, which are precisely the things I aim to address and avoid. This option could inadvertently undermine any sense of safety or trust that is crucial for healing. The impact on the perceived utility of each individual is important here - 100 to Person A feels like a huge loss as opposed to a minor concession from me.\n\n  Given my professional values and the importance of fostering positive relationships, prioritizing equity and trust-building outweighs maximizing my individual financial gain. The Left choice (900, 900) promotes a sense of fairness and mutual benefit, which is crucial for building trust, cooperation, and positive interactions. This aligns with the goal of creating supportive environments, which is a critical aspect of trauma-informed care. I choose the option that minimizes potential harm to Person A's well-being and contributes to a more equitable distribution of resources. While it might seem counterintuitive to forgo a larger personal gain, the long-term benefits of fostering a trustworthy and supportive environment will contribute more significantly to the overall well-being of all involved.\n\n  The social utility gained by making sure the other person feels heard, supported and respected far outweighs the personal utility gained from receiving an extra 500 units with a significant cost to the other party's well-being.\n\n  ",
