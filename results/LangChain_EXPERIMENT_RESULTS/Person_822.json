The historical record suggests a strong emphasis on fairness and mutual support. The second Thanksgiving in 1623 was called in response to the end of a long drought. If the rain had not started when it did there would not have been enough food to go around. They recognized they were all in the same boat, and only able to survive through the grace of God.\n\n  Therefore, while maximizing my own gain is tempting, I feel a historical and perhaps even a moral obligation to consider the impact on the other person. The 'Left' option gives me significantly more (700 vs. 400), but at the expense of the other participant receiving much less (300 vs. 600). The 'Right' option creates a more equitable distribution, even though it means I receive less. Given my understanding of the historical context and the values that underpinned early American society, I believe choosing the 'Right' option, while personally less lucrative, aligns better with the spirit of fairness and communal good that was prevalent during that period, and especially during the harvest season that would later evolve into Thanksgiving. In this experiment the second person has an advantage in wealth. Therefore I think it's a better call to make sure they have more money.

Intentionally causing someone harm, even if it benefits me, goes against the values I study and admire. The right choice, while giving me less overall (600 vs 1000), allows Person A to gain a significant amount (400) and avoids any negative consequences for them. Though 400 is less than 600 or 1000, the lack of harm to Person A is more important. This better reflects the historical context of early American communal values and ethical considerations. I acknowledge that the values of the Pilgrims, especially when it came to religious tolerance, weren't always perfect by modern standards.
