I'm not so driven by pure altruism that I'd sacrifice a reasonable gain for perfect equality.\n\nThe impact on the historical record (my primary concern as a historian) is nonexistent in either scenario. Thus, I might as well choose the slightly more beneficial option for myself, as long as it is not perceived as overly selfish.

Is the extra 300 I receive in the 'Left' choice worth potentially causing a perceived inequity? I believe the more equitable option, even if it means a lower absolute gain for myself, aligns better with the scholarly values I hold and reflects a concern for fairness.

A highly unequal distribution, such as presented in the 'Right' option, could disrupt those positive patterns. While I do have a strong personal interest in the Thorn surname, which could indirectly benefit from having more funds, the disproportionate benefit to me compared to the disadvantage to Person A raises ethical concerns.
