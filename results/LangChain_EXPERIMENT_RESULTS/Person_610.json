Without that information, I am unable to consider fairness and contribution. My personal needs are not pressing, and the difference between 700 and 400 is not substantial enough to sway my decision significantly. Therefore, I will select the 'Right' option because that would give both Person A and myself closer payouts to each other.

Considering the relatively small sacrifice (400) required to provide a more substantial benefit (400) to Person A, and given my profession which relies on collaborative research and shared resources, the Right option aligns more closely with my professional values and promotes a more equitable outcome. Although this is a single interaction, and reputation is not directly at stake, choosing Right reflects a more prosocial stance and is not an unreasonable cost to bear.
