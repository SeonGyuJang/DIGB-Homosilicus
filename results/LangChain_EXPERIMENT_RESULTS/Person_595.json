Given the experiment focuses on small benefit trade-offs, I would consider the monetary benefit provided to me. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Left Option (Equal Split):** This option promotes fairness and equity. If I was dealing with other researchers in my lab who I value long-term relationships with, this would be ideal. In this simple game with a random participant, this isn't important.\n*   **Right Option (Unequal Split, but I get more):** This maximizes my personal gain. An extra 100 units of currency might be useful in further experiments or research.\n\n\nUltimately, although I lean towards equality and societal benefit, the difference in the setup makes the difference between outcomes negligible.
