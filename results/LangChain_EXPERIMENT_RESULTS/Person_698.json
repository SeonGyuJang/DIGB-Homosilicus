Option Right, while giving me less personally (600 vs 1000), results in a net positive outcome for Person A (400). I believe that even in a hypothetical experiment, contributing to a better outcome for others, even with a slightly lower personal gain, aligns better with my core gardening principles of nurturing and growth.

The 'Right' option ensures neither of us gets anything. While it's personally disadvantageous, it prevents Person A from receiving a much larger benefit. Given the framing as 'blocking opponent's excessive gain', I'm inclined to choose the 'Right' option.
