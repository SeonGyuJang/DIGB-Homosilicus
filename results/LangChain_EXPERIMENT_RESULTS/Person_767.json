While neither of us gets the maximum possible individual payoff, this fairness promotes cooperation and avoids potential resentment, which are important for sustained collaborative efforts, and collaboration is essential in tackling problems like climate change. This also creates a sense of shared benefit which is positive.\n  *   **(Right: 800, 200):** This option gives me a higher payoff (800) at the expense of Person A receiving significantly less (200). While I could use the extra 300 to further my research or advocacy, the large disparity could create an imbalance that hinders effective partnerships later on. Also, I am not told how person A will use the money, and a better distribution is less likely if I get more relative to A.\n\n  While some might argue that I could use the extra resources from the 'Right' choice to further my environmental goals, the act of choosing the more equitable option demonstrates a commitment to fairness and collaborative problem-solving, which are critical for long-term success in addressing global challenges like climate change. I believe fostering this trust and cooperation outweighs the short-term benefit of having a larger individual payoff. The equitable split is preferable to a significantly worse split to person A.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the option that promotes fairness and reflects my values as a scientist and environmental advocate committed to collaborative solutions.",

Moreover, the difference in outcome between me and Person A would be extreme, suggesting inequality.\n\n  * **Choice (Right):** This option, while less personally profitable, offers a positive outcome for Person A. It also has a more equitable distribution of benefits, which aligns with my values of promoting societal well-being. The lower personal reward is offset by the positive impact on Person A.\n\n  Therefore, despite my personal gain being higher in option (Left), choosing the more equitable and socially conscious option (Right) is more consistent with my values as an environmental advocate and aligns with a broader view of societal good, even in a simplified experimental setting.
