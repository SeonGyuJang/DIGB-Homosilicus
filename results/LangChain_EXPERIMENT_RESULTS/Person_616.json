The slight decrease for Person A does not seem detrimental given the context. As a teacher, resourcefulness is key.

This could include purchasing new books, software, or even funding small group intervention programs.\n\nWeighing these competing values, the incremental benefit to my ability to help students outweighs the abstract fairness concern.
