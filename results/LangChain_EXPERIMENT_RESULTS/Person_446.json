Looking at the options, I see a clear disparity. Choosing the right option, while giving me a larger sum, drastically reduces the amount for the other person. The left option, while giving me less overall, promotes equality. It is important to have an attitude of equality toward others. Although it is nice to have a slightly larger amount, it shouldn't be at the expense of someone else's welfare.
