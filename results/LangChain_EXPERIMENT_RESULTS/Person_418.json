As a music teacher, I strive to instill in my students not only the technical skills necessary to play their instruments but also the values of cooperation and fairness, which resonates with the tuba's supportive role in brass ensembles. I also recognize the value in fostering positive relationships. A starkly unequal distribution, even with a personal benefit, can damage such relationships.

The 'Right' option, while resulting in neither of us receiving anything, at least avoids this sense of imbalance. It's a 'lose-lose' situation, but it's a more equitable one.
