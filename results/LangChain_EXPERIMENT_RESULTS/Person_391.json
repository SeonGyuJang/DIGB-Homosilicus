My choice should reflect values that would ultimately benefit my ability to deliver accurate and comprehensive results, which build my reputation with the regulator and other clients. Receiving 600 while the other party gets 0 would seem unnecessarily greedy, and could be interpreted negatively if this were a reflection of how I treat external or internal stakeholders. While I could always use the money to support my efforts, building reputation with the regulators is what I need in the long term. Splitting the money 400-400 fosters a sense of fairness and collaboration, which is more beneficial in maintaining good working relationships with regulatory bodies, clients, and other stakeholders. It also indirectly reflects positively on ALS Environmental's commitment to ethical practices and collaborative data sharing, which are crucial for the long-term integrity of environmental research.
