Given the precarious economic situation Russia faced in 2015 with threats of recession, high inflation, and banking system instability, promoting fairness, even at a personal cost, is crucial.

In 2015, Russia faced significant economic hardship due to sanctions, oil price declines, and import bans. Therefore, while 700 is objectively more than 400, the difference isn't so large that I'd completely disregard the other player's outcome. A decision leaning towards a more equitable outcome, even if slightly less for myself, could be construed as promoting a more cooperative environment which mirrors the type of environment Russia needs to weather economic hardship. However, the need to safeguard limited resources is paramount when facing recession, high inflation, and potential banking crises.

Given the context, an extra 500 rubles could alleviate some pressure on my finances if I were in this situation.\n\nBalancing my desire for some measure of equity and the necessity for economic benefit for myself and person A, the right side is beneficial to both of us.",
