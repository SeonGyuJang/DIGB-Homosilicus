I believe that a society that prioritizes fairness and equality is ultimately more resilient and prosperous. Furthermore, the study of religious texts often reveals the dangers of unchecked self-interest. The distribution on the right, where I get more while A gets significantly less, makes me question if I am contributing to inequality, which is not in line with the ethos I see in the Hebrew Bible.\n\n  Therefore, while there is a temptation to choose the option that maximizes my immediate gain, my scholarly understanding compels me to choose the option that promotes greater equality and minimizes potential disparity.",

Choosing the 'Left' seems akin to selfishly exploiting a situation, creating a negative impact on another person.
