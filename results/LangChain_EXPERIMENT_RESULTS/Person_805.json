From a purely utilitarian perspective, the Right choice yields a total of 400, while the Left choice yields 400. However, as a cleanup company, efficiency is paramount. From that perspective, the equal distribution of 200 is most efficient.\n\n  The equal allocation, despite its simplicity, is justifiable as the most efficient and fair initial distribution.
