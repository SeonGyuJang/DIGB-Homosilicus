This reflects a balanced sense of community responsibility.

While personal gain was undoubtedly a motivator (raids, exploration), the success of a Viking settlement or expedition relied heavily on cooperation and trust amongst its members. The sagas are full of examples of feuds erupting when resources were perceived to be unfairly distributed, leading to societal breakdown. That being said, the pursuit of wealth and power was also a significant part of Viking culture, and opportunities for individual advancement were often seized. \n\nIn this scenario, I am faced with a choice between a perfectly equal distribution and a situation where I receive significantly more than the other person. While the Viking in me might be tempted by the larger personal gain (1400 vs 900), the knowledge that a strong and cooperative community is essential for long-term success weighs heavily. The other person receives a paltry 100 in the 'Right' option, which seems excessively unfair and could potentially breed resentment or mistrust. While a perfect egalitarian society is likely unattainable and even undesirable (considering the hierarchical structure of Viking society), the 'Right' option creates too large a disparity.\n\nTherefore, while a small gain for me while a gain for others is fine, a very large gain is not. Also, my persona's interests don't extend far enough to care about maximizing the total payout - only reducing the disparity and making sure my own payout is reasonably large.

I'm mindful of fairness and avoiding unnecessary harm. Reducing Person A's outcome by -200 seems excessive. Option Right, while giving me less (600), provides Person A with a positive outcome (400). The overall well-being of the group is arguably better in Option Right. While Viking settlements might sometimes involve ruthless actions, I'll interpret 'Viking values' here as more nuanced than pure self-interest.
