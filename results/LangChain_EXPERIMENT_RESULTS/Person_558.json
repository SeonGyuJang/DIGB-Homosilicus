The 'Left' option prioritizes my own gain (700) over the other person's (300). The 'Right' option, however, significantly increases the other person's gain (600) while decreasing my own (400).\n\n  From a purely selfish perspective, 'Left' is the obvious choice. However, historical analysis often reveals the longer-term consequences of such purely self-serving actions. Building goodwill and fostering cooperation can, in the long run, be more beneficial. While this isn't a situation with long-term implications, the principle remains relevant. The 'Right' option isn't altruistic to the point of self-sacrifice, but it shows a consideration for the other person that isn't present in the 'Left' option.\n\n  Given the constraints of this scenario and my historical perspective on power and resource allocation, I will cautiously choose an option that demonstrates some consideration for the other participant without severely compromising my own potential gain. While someone like Caesar might aggressively pursue the 'Left' option, I believe the more pragmatic and politically savvy Augustus would see the subtle advantage of choosing 'Right', even if it's only a minor one.
