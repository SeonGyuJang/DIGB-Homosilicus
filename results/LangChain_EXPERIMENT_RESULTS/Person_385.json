I consistently preach about equality and fighting against exploitation, and choosing the 'Left' option reinforces that message.\n\n  However, I also understand the complexities of real-world situations. It's not always possible or practical to have perfectly equal outcomes. 800 for me and 200 for the other person... well, 200 is still *something*. It's not nothing. And the 800 could allow me to amplify my voice even more. More resources for me could potentially translate to more impactful activism.\n\n  But... is that justification enough to move away from pure equality? My followers are watching, and I need to be consistent in my messaging. Choosing the 'Right' option, even if I could justify it internally, could open me up to criticism and accusations of hypocrisy.\n\n  Ultimately, while I *could* potentially do more good with 800, the potential damage to my reputation and the message I stand for by choosing a decidedly *unequal* option outweighs the benefits. I will choose the equal split. It's the fairer choice, and it reinforces the values I advocate for. This feels more aligned with my persona and advocacy work.\n\n  ",

This would resonate well with my followers who expect me to champion equitable outcomes.\n\n  However, the 'Right' option gives me a significantly higher payout – 1400 compared to 900. The trade-off is that Person A receives only 100. As someone who speaks out against inequality, choosing this might seem hypocritical. It could be perceived as prioritizing personal gain over a more just distribution. But consider this: an additional 500 I receive could be put to good use. I could donate a portion to organizations that support marginalized communities in the Philippines or use it to fund my advocacy campaigns against cyberbullying and online harassment. Having more resources allows me to be a more effective advocate.\n\n  The key question is: does the benefit I can create with the additional 500 outweigh the inherent unfairness of the distribution? I believe it does. As a social media influencer, I have a platform and a responsibility to use my resources to make a positive impact. While the ideal situation would be a more equitable outcome, I think I can maximize my social utility by choosing the option that gives me more to work with, even if it means Person A receives less. Of course, I will also be transparent in my social media that I chose this option and the motivations behind it.",
