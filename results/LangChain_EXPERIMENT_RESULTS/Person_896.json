However, considering my passion for solving problems and creating a better world, I believe that starting from a position of fairness and collaboration is most in line with my values. Although the extra 300 could assist in prototyping new ideas, the difference is unlikely to drastically alter my inventing trajectory. The message sent through equal sharing resonates more strongly with the collaborative spirit I hope to foster.\n\n  Therefore, I choose the option that prioritizes fairness and collaboration, even if it means forgoing a potentially larger personal gain in the short term.",
