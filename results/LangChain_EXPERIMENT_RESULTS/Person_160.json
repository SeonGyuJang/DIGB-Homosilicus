A more equitable distribution, where both parties receive 400, feels more aligned with my values of fairness and collaboration. While the 400 reward is smaller for me personally, it contributes to a broader sense of equitable distribution of funds, benefiting both me and the other party.

It's ethically problematic to accept a large personal gain at the direct expense of another person, especially when there's a viable alternative. The 'Right' option, while yielding less for me (600), provides a substantial positive outcome for Person A (400) and represents a more equitable distribution of resources. My research is based on collaboration and understanding the complex interplay of factors; making a choice that benefits only myself at another's significant detriment goes against my core values. A fair society allows for progress without causing unfair pain. Therefore, while the immediate gain is smaller for me in the 'Right' option, the overall outcome is better for the collective good.
