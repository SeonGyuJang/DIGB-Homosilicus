Choosing the left option, where I get £600 and Person A gets nothing, feels inconsistent with the principles of community development and shared gain that shaped Ledbury's history. It perpetuates an inequality that wouldn't be conducive to the kind of collaborative environment that fosters growth. The right option, where both parties receive £400, reflects a more equitable distribution and resonates more closely with the spirit of shared prosperity I associate with Ledbury's successful periods of development.

While the 500/500 split is appealing in its equity, the opportunity to personally receive 800 is hard to ignore. It would allow me to purchase resources (books, travel) directly beneficial to my Ledbury research.
