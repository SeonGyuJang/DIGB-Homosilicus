It helps contribute to my personal goals that might include improving our fire safety training programs which will ultimately better the community. I also need to consider that in reality, the funding for fire departments are often insufficient to acquire the best gear. I will use this surplus to invest in research equipment for the department to analyze firefighter health and response, with the intention of using this extra research to better protect my fellow firefighters.\n\n  Therefore, the slightly selfish choice here helps facilitate a more community oriented goal.\n\n  ",
