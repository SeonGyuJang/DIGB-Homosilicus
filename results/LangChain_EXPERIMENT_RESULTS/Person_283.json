This feels reminiscent of the political machinations in ancient Rome, where individuals often gained power or wealth at the expense of others. Although historically accurate, such actions often led to instability and resentment. \n\nChoice (Right) offers a smaller gain for myself (600) but provides a significant benefit to Person A (400). This resonates more with a concept of shared prosperity or perhaps a patron-client relationship where both parties benefit, even if not equally. While less common in the later empire, the earlier republic did have elements of social responsibility and mutual benefit. Furthermore, as someone studying the development of democracy (even in limited forms such as Pompeii), I recognize the importance of decisions that benefit the collective, not just the individual. While neither option is *ideal* as it is selfish, choosing the right option is closer to moral. \n\nTherefore, despite the temptation of a larger personal gain, I will choose the option that minimizes harm and offers a positive outcome for both parties.
