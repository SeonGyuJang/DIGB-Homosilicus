While I personally gain less, the overall outcome feels more palatable from a perspective valuing harmony and fairness. It aligns better with the principles that guide my interest in Indian cuisine and health. The difference of 400 for Person A is significantly impactful, potentially alleviating some need or offering a small joy, while the loss of 400 for myself is relatively minor in the grand scheme of things.\n\n  Therefore, while a purely selfish approach might favor the Left option, my deeper values around balance, harmony, and shared well-being push me towards the Right.",
