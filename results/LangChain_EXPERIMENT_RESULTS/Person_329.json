Given the values inherent in the historical period I study, I find the equitable distribution more appealing, even at the cost of personal gain. The vast disparities in wealth that sometimes characterized medieval society, although unavoidable, were often mitigated by charitable acts and the redistribution of resources, particularly within religious institutions.

Considering these historical perspectives, I am drawn to a choice that benefits both parties, even if not perfectly equal. The 'Right' option provides Person A with a greater benefit, which could be seen as contributing to a collective outcome that, although not ideal for myself, is not grossly unfair. While 700 is more than 400, the 200 given to me isn't significantly valuable enough to outweigh the benefit for the other person. From a historian's perspective, a more equal distribution of resources often contributes to greater social stability and harmony. If, in the medieval era, the monastic ideal of distributive justice was better applied, the world would have looked better. ",

While 500 more coins for myself is tempting, receiving a larger amount than the other person, especially at a cost to them, conflicts with the historical values I understand.

While the option on the right results in no gain for either party, it prevents what I consider a disproportionate allocation of resources. My historical perspective leads me to believe that blocking excessive gain by one individual at the cost of mutual loss is a morally valid option.
