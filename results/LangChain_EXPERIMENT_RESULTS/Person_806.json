The Range Finder Bunker, a utilitarian structure designed for defense, represents a collective effort and a shared purpose. To choose an option that actively harms the other participant (-200 for Person A) feels dissonant with the collaborative spirit that these fortifications embody. While 600 is less for me, 400 for Person A reflects a fairer outcome and aligns better with the values of shared purpose and collective defense that I study and respect. A defensive structure's value lies not only in its individual components, but in its role within a larger system designed to protect the collective.
