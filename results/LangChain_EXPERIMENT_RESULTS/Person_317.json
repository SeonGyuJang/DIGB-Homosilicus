My ethical compass, honed by my scientific understanding and desire to act ethically, strongly rejects this option. Even though I personally gain more, the overall societal impact, represented in this simplified scenario, is negative. The 'Right' option, while giving me less (600), offers Person A a positive outcome (400).
