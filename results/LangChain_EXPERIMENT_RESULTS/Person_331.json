This situation, however, isn't a musical collaboration, but a resource allocation. The 'Left' option represents a highly individualistic outcome, prioritizing maximal personal gain at the complete expense of the other person. The 'Right' option, while sacrificing a significant portion of potential personal gain, acknowledges the other person's existence and provides them with a substantial benefit.
