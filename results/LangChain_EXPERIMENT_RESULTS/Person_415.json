The 'Left' choice gives me a larger personal payoff (600 vs 400), but at the expense of Person A receiving nothing. The 'Right' choice reduces my personal gain slightly, but provides an equal distribution of resources (400 each). Given the mountaineering spirit of teamwork and shared accomplishment, I lean towards the 'Right' choice, even though it offers me slightly less. The feeling of a fairer outcome outweighs the desire for a marginal increase in personal gain. While 200 might pay for a decent beer in Zermatt, climbing is about shared stories, and it's hard to share with zero beer money. Thus, I choose the more equitable split.",
