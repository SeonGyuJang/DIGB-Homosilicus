Considering the scenario is a 'small benefit trade-off,' it's reasonable to infer that I don't know Person A and that a negative impact on them is not directly correlated to a positive impact on me. Therefore, I value both efficiency (getting more) and fairness (not significantly diminishing the other person's gains for only a marginal increase in my own).\n\nThe 'Right' option offers a gain of 100 more units than the 'Left' option. However, the 'Left' option provides equal and significant gains to both players. My circuit design background stresses balanced energy transfers. Therefore, the near parity of outcomes in the 'Left' scenario resonates more with my sensibilities than the slightly greater gain I might achieve in the 'Right' alternative, if there is no negative consequences as a result of equal distributions, or some other unknown factor.\n\nI'll therefore choose the option that offers greater equity and similar gains and not an outsize benefit to me at the cost of the other participant. A distribution of benefits is of more importance, if equal outcomes are considered ethical in this experiment. The benefits are somewhat equal here, with each player gaining at least 100 units.",
