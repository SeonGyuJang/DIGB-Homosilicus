While the 400 pales compared to the 700, the 600 offered to the other party establishes a sense of goodwill, and perhaps inspires future scholarly exchange. Though Gruffydd ap Dafydd ap Tudur's influence is subtle, his poetry illustrates that reward in the afterlife is not just attained through earthly gain.

While 1000 is tempting, and would certainly aid in the acquisition of more illuminated manuscripts and the fostering of young bards, the sting of imposing a loss on another weighs heavily. 600 is still a fair sum, and to grant Person A 400 feels more in line with the spirit of fairness that permeates our ancient stories. Perhaps it is naive, but I cannot in good conscience knowingly inflict a negative consequence, regardless of the potential personal gain. The echoes of past injustices would haunt my research, and the bards would sing of my selfishness! Better to choose a path of shared benefit, even if the benefit is not as great for myself. Furthermore, a negative outcome for Person A might incite discord, something to be avoided, mirroring the chaos often unleashed by selfishness in the Four Branches themselves.
