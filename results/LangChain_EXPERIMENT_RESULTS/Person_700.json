In the grand scheme of things, and considering the historical perspective I tend to have, the difference between 1000 and 600 is less significant than the ethical consideration of sharing. The Mycenaeans, despite their impressive structures, ultimately fell. Cooperation and a shared society often prove more resilient in the long run.
