However, the 'Left' choice, while perfectly fair, reduces my potential gains significantly. The difference between the options is 300. This isn't negligible.\n\nMy field informs me that humans aren't simply altruistic robots. We do assess our own value and contributions. A drastic difference might push me toward pure self-interest. In this scenario, Person A still receives a reasonable amount (200) in the 'Right' option. Therefore, while valuing fairness, maximizing potential gains within the bounds of reasonable distribution feels more justifiable in this case. The slight imbalance in distribution doesn't significantly impact A, yet it significantly improves my outcome.

From an evolutionary perspective, ensuring a baseline survival and reproductive success (100) for another individual can benefit the gene pool even if they are not related.

From an evolutionary perspective, studies have shown that cooperation, even in seemingly 'altruistic' situations, can ultimately benefit the individual's kin group or even the larger social group, leading to long-term gains. Given that this is a one-shot experiment, the direct benefits of fostering cooperation are minimal.

The difference between 900 and 1400, while significant, doesn't outweigh the value of ensuring a more even playing field for both participants, perhaps fostering trust and future cooperation (even if this experiment is one-shot). Furthermore, as a scientist, I appreciate the value of maximizing overall 'utility' within the system, which leans towards a more equitable distribution. The Right option presents a scenario where one person benefits disproportionately, potentially leading to resentment or instability in a longer, more complex interaction.

Although Person A is not necessarily related to me and this isn't a direct kin selection issue, choosing the 'Left' option would likely be detrimental to overall population fitness if widely adopted. The 'Right' option, while yielding a smaller personal reward, creates a mutually beneficial outcome. From an evolutionary perspective, fostering cooperation and positive interactions, even at a small personal cost, ultimately benefits the population and, indirectly, myself. While the magnitude of -200 to A isn't crippling, the 'Right' option promotes a fairer distribution and aligns better with the principles of cooperation and mutual benefit that have driven human evolutionary success.
