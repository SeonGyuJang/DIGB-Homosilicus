Option (Right) offers me a slightly lower 'data rate' (400 units) but delivers a much better overall 'viewing experience' (400 units to Person A). While I appreciate a high personal 'data rate,' I recognize that a more 'compressed' (equitable) distribution is ultimately more efficient in terms of overall 'utility'. I also dislike the idea of someone getting absolutely nothing while I get a significant amount. It feels wasteful, like over-encoding a static scene with a ridiculously high bitrate. While losing 200 units is non-trivial, achieving equality and ensuring Person A also receives something is worth the 'compression penalty.'
