The 'Right' option, while resulting in zero for both, prevents this skewed outcome. Given that my primary persona focuses on long-term progress and fairness, I will choose the option that prevents this imbalance, even if it means sacrificing a smaller personal gain. This also subtly signals the need for fairer distribution in future collaborations.
