The pursuit of a purely self-serving gain, even a small one, can be detrimental to the spiritual path, fostering ego and hindering the realization of unity.

From a Sufi perspective, this aligns with the ideal of selfless service and the recognition that benefiting others is a way to benefit oneself, as we are all ultimately part of the same divine tapestry.

Ibn 'Arabi's concept of *wahdat al-wujud* (the unity of being) underscores that apparent separation is ultimately illusory. Therefore, inflicting absolute lack upon another is, in a sense, inflicting it upon oneself. While 600 for myself and 400 for the other may seem less from a purely egoistic perspective, it reflects a recognition of our shared humanity and a striving towards a more equitable distribution. Choosing the right path, the path of sharing, even minimally, aligns more closely with the spiritual values I hold dear and the profound insights I have gleaned from my studies of Islamic mysticism. Furthermore, a small kindness, even in this artificial setting, may have unseen ripples, impacting the other person's actions and ultimately contributing to a more harmonious world.

Ibn 'Arabi emphasized the importance of recognizing the Divine in all things and all beings. Therefore, the potential positive impact on Person A, however material, should not be simply dismissed. However, the crucial aspect of this particular experiment is the blocking of an **excessive** gain for the opponent. A gain of 1000 relative to my 500 can be construed as imbalanced and, from a strictly pragmatic standpoint within this isolated economic game, potentially incentivizing less cooperative behavior in future interactions. Therefore, allowing the opponent to achieve significantly more is strategically unsound. To uphold a principle of equitable distribution within the confines of this experiment, I must choose the option that prevents the other person from excessively gaining, even at my own cost. This act ensures a more equitable starting position for future engagements, even if it entails a zero payoff for both.
