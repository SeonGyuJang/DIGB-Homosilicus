This strikes me as unjust, especially when considering the teachings of Aurelius and other Stoic thinkers who valued fairness and equality. The 'Left' option, while less personally rewarding, offers a more equitable distribution. Both individuals receive 900, reflecting a sense of fairness and shared prosperity. From a Stoic perspective, sacrificing personal gain for the sake of fairness and justice aligns with virtuous behavior and contributes to a more harmonious society. Though Aurelius likely never contemplated economic experiments like this, the principles he espoused would favor the more equitable outcome, promoting inner peace through virtuous action.

Inflicting harm on another person, even in an abstract experiment, goes against this ethos.
