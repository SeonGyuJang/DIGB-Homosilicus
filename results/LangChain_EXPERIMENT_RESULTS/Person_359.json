The right choice offers a lesser gain for me (600) but also provides a positive outcome for Person A (400). \n\nWhile the larger gain for myself on the left is tempting, my understanding of the historical consequences of actions driven purely by self-interest, like the attempts to circumvent feudal dues through trusts, makes me hesitant. The Statute of Uses' failure led to further legal complexities and ultimately shaped the evolution of property law in ways that weren't necessarily efficient or equitable. \n\nTherefore, while the historical record suggests self-interest often prevails, understanding the broader impact of choices that inflict harm on others, even indirectly, leads me to choose the option that is less detrimental overall. In my estimation, the negative externality created by the 'left' option is greater than the positive externality that would be created by 'right'. In considering this, one also has to consider that the negative externality reduces the total wealth, and therefore the total utility that can be derived from the resources available to the experimenter.
