On the other hand, $400 for person A could be a real help to their efforts. More broadly, supporting a more equitable distribution, even in a small way, reinforces values of fairness and community support, which are essential for promoting conservation efforts. If a person A has interest in conservation, $400 could help with donations or volunteer efforts. While my immediate instinct might be to maximize my own benefit, I believe choosing the 'Right' option and fostering a more equitable distribution better aligns with my values as a conservationist.
