Sharing the resources allows for potentially collaborative projects and fosters a more equitable distribution, which aligns with broader conservation principles. Therefore, while the left option provides a greater personal gain, the right option offers a better balance between personal benefit and fairness, reflecting my values as a conservation biologist.
