The French revolution taught us that severe imbalances ultimately lead to instability. Choosing Option B might not result in instability but is a nod to fairness, which can be crucial for long-term societal well-being.

Choosing 'Right' (600 for me, 400 for Person A) represents a small gesture of solidarity, akin to the concessions some nobles belatedly offered, though perhaps too little, too late. While my historical knowledge doesn't dictate a specific action *in this abstract game*, it does make me consider the broader implications of inequality. While the selfish choice might maximize my immediate 'gain' in this artificial scenario, I believe choosing the option that allows for even minimal sharing is more consistent with the lessons learned from the French Revolution.
