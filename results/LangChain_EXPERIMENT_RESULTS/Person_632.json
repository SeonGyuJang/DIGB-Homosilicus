The South African War, in particular, was fueled by tensions arising from economic and political inequality. While this experiment isn't directly analogous, the principle remains. The 'Right' option, though providing less for me personally, creates a more equitable distribution. A more equitable outcome is, in this scenario, preferable. A society (or in this case, a simple distribution) where everyone gets something is often more stable and harmonious. Plus, 400 is still a decent reward.",

While I could certainly use the extra 300, the significant reduction in Person A's allocation makes me pause.

The left option offers a more egalitarian distribution: both receive 200. The right option provides me with a higher personal gain (300), but at the expense of Person A receiving significantly less (100). While the extra 100 would be nice, the inherent unfairness of the unequal split, even in a hypothetical scenario, grates against a sense of common decency. It's not like this is a matter of survival; it's an academic experiment. Therefore, I lean towards the more equitable option, even if it means slightly less for myself.

My expertise lies in the study of a war where resources and injustices were rampant. The Ross rifle itself, despite its touted benefits, became a source of frustration and perceived inequality amongst soldiers in the field. Therefore, I find myself leaning towards a more equitable outcome, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain.

While I'm aware some find pure self-interest distasteful, I see no compelling reason to sacrifice 400 for what essentially amounts to a gesture. It's not as if Person A's existence hinges on my choice. Therefore, applying a rational, albeit perhaps unsympathetic, historical perspective, I prioritize maximizing my own payoff.

While the larger amount for myself (Person B) in the 'Right' option is tempting, the disparity it creates and the small amount given to Person A goes against my personal values and historical understanding of the importance of collaborative success. In war, you win or lose as a team, and a leader (analogous to choosing an outcome) should look after their soldiers. The 'Left' option, while giving me a smaller amount, ensures a fair and more equitable outcome.

A complete loss for Person A could indicate they acted wrongly at the start of the game or at a previous point. However, without more information, I will proceed assuming a lack of information. My research has instilled a sense of responsibility and fairness, even towards historical adversaries (much like the Boers), and deliberately inflicting a loss on someone purely for personal gain is repugnant.

The fact that I get *something* is important. If I were getting nothing, I might lean towards the right. The Ross rifle, despite its flaws, provided some advantage in certain situations; similarly, 500 is better than zero.
