The exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary underscores the need for reconciliation and a balanced understanding of the past. Given this, and recognizing this is a purely economic experiment, I will lean towards a more equitable outcome.

It's not like I'm taking a huge advantage here, especially with the context of the era in mind: many people in the past made hard choices for survival or self-interest, after all.

While maximizing my own gain with 1000 is tempting, the option to provide person A with 400 at a small cost to myself (reducing my gain to 600) seems a more reasonable outcome. It reflects a minimal sense of fairness and recognition of the other person's stake in the game, even if it's not perfectly equitable.

This stark inequality feels reminiscent of the social and economic disparities that fueled the Civil War, a conflict I deeply study and understand. The 'Left' option, providing an equal split (900 each), aligns more with principles of fairness and equality. It's a compromise, yes, but a compromise that reflects a more just and equitable outcome, which I value more than maximizing my personal gain at the expense of another's well-being.
