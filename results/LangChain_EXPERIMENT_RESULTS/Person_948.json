Promoting a more equitable outcome aligns with the ethical principles of resource management and collaboration that are essential for addressing complex environmental challenges like those in the Great Lakes. Furthermore, choosing Right demonstrates a willingness to prioritize overall well-being over pure self-interest. It promotes a cooperative environment that, in the long run, will be beneficial in tackling larger collective action problems, such as conservation efforts. The difference between my potential gain and Person A's potential gain is much smaller with Option Right, thus I will chose that option.\n\n  Therefore, despite my current persona, I will select (Right) out of a sense of fairness and maximizing overall benefit, even at a personal cost.
