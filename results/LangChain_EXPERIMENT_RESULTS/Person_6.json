While I am not explicitly trained in economics, the concept of inequality resonates with my understanding of societal disparities. In this scenario, the 'Left' option provides me with a larger individual payout (600) compared to the 'Right' option (400). However, it creates a large inequality, where Person A receives nothing. The 'Right' option, while giving me less (400), results in a more equitable distribution, with both Person A and I receiving the same amount.

While 600 is less than 1000, knowing that Person A will benefit significantly (receiving 400 instead of suffering -200) makes the right option more appealing.
