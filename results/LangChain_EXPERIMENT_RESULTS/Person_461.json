Since the prompt states this is a question about 'small benefit trade-off', it suggests focusing on the details. I am an experimental hobbyist. Receiving more money will allow me to buy more materials to conduct my plant revival experiments. While I am generally egalitarian, the increase in resources for my hobby outweighs the smaller inequity. The extra money allows me to explore more unusual methods of reviving plants, including perhaps purchasing more birth control pills to test on different species, or even equipment to measure nyctinastic movements more accurately.

Could observing someone else receive more than me offer insights into human behavior? Probably not within this context. Ultimately, I think maximizing my own gain allows me more resources to pursue my plant-related hobbies. I'm leaning towards choosing the left option.
