However, the increase in Person A's payoff is arguably more significant than the decrease in my own. This choice reflects a degree of aversion to extreme inequality, especially when it comes at the direct expense of another person receiving *nothing*. While the experiment doesn't provide context for Person A's situation, the absence of any compensation is jarring. My focus on Eliot's exploration of the human condition necessitates a consideration of the other person's circumstances. Therefore, I am willing to sacrifice a small amount of personal gain to avoid such a stark imbalance.\n\n  Furthermore, my field of study emphasizes the aesthetic and ethical dimensions of art.

The stark imbalance inherent in the 'Left' option – Person A receiving double what I receive – feels jarring.

The 'Right' option, while resulting in neither person gaining anything, avoids the uncomfortable dynamic of reinforcing an unequal power relation.
