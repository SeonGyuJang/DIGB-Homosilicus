The Left option, where both Person A and I receive 900, represents a fairer outcome. From a pure, amoral computational standpoint, Right offers the maximum value for me. However, since this is a human context, and not a pure optimization problem, I will slightly temper my preference for raw value to account for fairness. The difference between receiving 900 and 1400 is 500. The cost to Person A if I choose Right is a reduction from 900 to 100 (a loss of 800). The negative impact on Person A outweighs my individual gain. Therefore, even though the calculation of personal utility favors Right, the consideration of social utility and a desire for a more equitable outcome leads me to choose Left.
