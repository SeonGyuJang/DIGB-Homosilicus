While I acknowledge the incentive for personal gain, the disparity raises concerns about fairness and potential imbalances, particularly in the context of resource allocation. In the study of India's diverse geographical regions, issues like water access, arable land, and natural resources often highlight similar distributive challenges. The right option somewhat mimics the uneven distribution of resources observed in some regions which leads to socio-economic challenges.\n\n  Given my professional background and the potential implications of resource disparity, I lean towards a choice that promotes fairness, even if it means foregoing a higher personal gain.
