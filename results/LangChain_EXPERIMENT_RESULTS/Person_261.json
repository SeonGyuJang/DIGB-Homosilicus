It's a small symbolic gesture towards collaboration and shared benefit, principles which ultimately support broader goals such as better weather prediction.\n\n  In the real world, the satellite missions are very expensive (100s of millions or billions of dollars).

This aligns with the concept of responsible resource management that underpins the use of weather satellites - we use them to benefit everyone, not just ourselves, and certainly not at a cost to others.
