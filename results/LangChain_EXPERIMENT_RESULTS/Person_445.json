The alternative, while providing me with a smaller sum (400), creates equality. Since I can still get a respectable 400, this appears to be acceptable. Though as a designer I work on optimizing, and maximizing efficiency, I also believe in fairness and an equitable distribution of resources when possible. I also imagine a situation where the 400 given to Person A are an investment in his ability to design something that would benefit us both. And as an idealist, I am willing to settle for a slightly smaller payoff to ensure a sense of equality between us.",

The right option offers a significant increase in my own payout (300 vs. 200) for a relatively small decrease in Person A's payout (100 vs. 200). This trade-off maximizes my individual benefit without severely impacting the other person.
