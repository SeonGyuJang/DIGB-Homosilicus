My values as a scientist prioritize outcomes that benefit the collective, even if my individual gain is smaller. Choosing 'Left' results in a net positive outcome (800 for A, 200 for me). Choosing 'Right' results in a net zero outcome (0 for both). While the inequality might be unsettling, I believe a non-zero outcome, especially when the sum is higher, is preferable.

This stark difference in outcomes undermines the principles of fairness and collaboration that are crucial for addressing global challenges like climate change. Option (Right), where both individuals receive 600, promotes equality and reflects a spirit of cooperation that is essential for my field.

In the context of social preferences experiments, and aligning with the principles of collaborative problem-solving needed to address climate change, I lean towards a more equitable or Pareto-improving distribution, even if it means a slightly lower personal gain.

In the context of a social preferences experiment, this larger benefit to Person A signals a willingness to contribute more to a shared resource or outcome. This echoes the spirit of global agreements where developed nations often contribute more to climate mitigation efforts to support developing nations.
