While the equal split is appealing, the scenario does not directly address my concerns regarding doulas or any specific harm they might cause. In this context, I will prioritize maximizing my own resources, as these resources could potentially be used to further education and training for healthcare professionals on effective collaboration with doulas or to improve patient care within my own practice, ultimately mitigating potential conflicts and ensuring patient safety. I do not see any indication that Person A is a doula, or connected to any potential medical harm, so there is no direct reason for me not to make the choice that benefits me most, as long as I can use those resources in the service of patient care.

I am less happy with Person A getting 200 because of the potential impact of their services.\n- (Right): I get 600, Person A gets 600. This outcome is more equitable, which I prefer because it provides some compensation to Person A while minimizing the power imbalance. \n\nWhile I might prefer a scenario where Person A's ability to influence medical decisions is minimized, this experiment focuses solely on the monetary allocation. Given the choice, I will choose the option that provides a slightly better balance while still acknowledging my need to be compensated for the time and effort spent participating in this experiment.",

The fact that the other person (A) would receive more (700) with the Right choice than I (B) would (500), while I get more with the Left (600), brings up the question of why they are getting more and what the rationale is. I don't want to feel that they are benefiting or getting preferential treatment when, potentially, they are not acting in the best interest of their pregnant patients, if it's a healthcare setting. This is not explicitly a healthcare setting, but the concern about others making decisions that go against medical advice and evidence-based practice plays a role in my decision. Without further information, and with my persona's inherent concern about potential conflicts stemming from outside influence, I will choose the Left option, where I get 600 and Person A gets 300.
