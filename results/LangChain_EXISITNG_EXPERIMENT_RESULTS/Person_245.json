While receiving 200 would be beneficial, the scenario presents a situation where either both parties benefit significantly (although disproportionately), or neither benefits at all. My research aims to improve public health, and access to resources is crucial for achieving that goal. Even though Person A receives a larger portion of the resources in the 'Left' option, a total of 1000 resources are put to use, which is much better than zero resources available to anyone. I prioritize maximizing the overall pool of resources that can potentially be used for research or other beneficial activities. Therefore, I would choose the 'Left' option, even if it means I receive less than Person A, because it allows for a larger amount of total resources in the world. This promotes potential future discoveries and benefit to others.",

This extra 100 could be critical for purchasing supplies or equipment needed for my gut microbiome research, particularly related to zinc deficiency and prebiotic development. I believe my research benefits society as a whole, so prioritizing my own access to resources, within reason, is justified. The difference in Person A's payoff (700 vs. 300) is substantial, but the difference in my own payoff (600 vs. 500) has a larger impact on my ability to conduct future work.

Although a slightly smaller allocation is not a considerable detriment, it is hard to justify taking a small cut to give the other person substantially more.
