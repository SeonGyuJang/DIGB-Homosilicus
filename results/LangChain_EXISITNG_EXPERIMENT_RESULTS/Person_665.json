Purely from a self-interested perspective, I am indifferent between the two as I get the same. Locke might argue that I should lean towards the option that maximizes overall well-being, which is (Right). However, Locke also would not say I am obligated to make myself worse off to benefit others. Because I receive the same either way, I see no reason to avoid giving the other person more. A truly fair and just society considers the well-being of all. Therefore, I will choose the option that benefits both myself and the other person more, even though the only benefit to me is internal (satisfaction).",

While I acknowledge that some inequality may be inevitable, the option where Person A gets 800 and I get 200 presents a stark disparity. Although receiving 0 is undesirable, the possibility of perpetuating extreme inequality goes against my philosophical leanings. Locke believed in equality of opportunity and the capacity for rational self-governance. He argued against arbitrary power and for a government based on the consent of the governed. I see this choice as a micro-political decision. Choosing 'Left' would perpetuate a very skewed distribution. While I get something, I would essentially be agreeing to an unfair outcome, even though not directly imposing it on the other. Choosing 'Right' does not necessarily lead to a better distribution in other cases, but it shows a rejection of outcomes which are significantly unequal. While Locke might have been pragmatically concerned with ensuring at least some benefit for myself, the overwhelming disparity pushes me to choose the 'Right' option to reflect my philosophical commitment to fairness, even if it means receiving nothing in this instance. Thus, although I get something with the 'Left' option, the disparity is too large to tolerate. The 'Right' option provides the best outcome for reflecting my moral and philosophical beliefs.",

While Locke emphasized self-ownership and the right to acquire property, he also advocated for a government that protects the common good. In this scenario, I am faced with a decision that impacts both myself and another individual. The left option provides me with a higher absolute payoff (600) compared to the right option (500). However, the right option results in a higher payoff for the other person (700 compared to 300). Choosing the left option maximizes my personal gain at the expense of the other person's well-being, potentially exacerbating inequality. Choosing the right option decreases my personal gain but increases the other person's gain more significantly, leading to a more equitable distribution of resources. Considering Locke's emphasis on the common good and the importance of a just society, I will choose the right option, despite it being personally less beneficial. This decision reflects a concern for fairness and the well-being of others, aligning with Locke's ideals of a society governed by reason and justice. While maximizing individual utility is important, it should not come at the cost of fairness and the collective good. Locke believed that individuals are rational beings capable of cooperation and empathy. Thus, opting for a slightly lower personal gain while significantly benefiting the other person reflects this belief in human cooperation and concern for the welfare of others.",

This aligns with Locke's emphasis on equality and fairness within a just society. Option (Right), however, presents an unequal distribution, favoring Person A with 750 while I receive 375. While this may seem unfair at first glance, it's important to consider whether the increased overall benefit justifies the disparity. \n\nIn Locke's philosophy, there is a strong belief in the importance of progress and societal good. While strict equality is desirable, it can be overridden if maximizing the collective welfare yields a better outcome for all, even if that means a slight inequality. In this specific case, Person A's payoff more than doubles my loss.
