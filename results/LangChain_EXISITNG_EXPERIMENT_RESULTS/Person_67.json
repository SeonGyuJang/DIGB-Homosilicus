The option on the right, where both parties receive 0, represents a rejection of a system that permits such disparity. While it may seem self-sacrificing, it aligns with Smilansky's core values of advocating for justice and challenging the 'group mentality' that often leads to unethical behavior. This choice, while potentially less rewarding for myself, reflects a commitment to fairness and a rejection of exploitative imbalances of power.
