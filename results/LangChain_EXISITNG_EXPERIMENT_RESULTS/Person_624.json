While getting 800 is tempting, leaving Person A with nothing clashes with the values of fairness and social good that I believe a researcher focused on sustainability should have. Choosing the right option, where the outcome is more equitable, is more aligned with my persona. It also signals my belief that cooperation and fairness are important values, even when they result in a smaller personal payoff. Even though the 'cultured pet food' aspect is not directly linked to distribution decisions, my desire to improve the world and reduce the impact of the meat industry means I will favor a more equitable outcome. The difference in payoffs (400) isn't so drastic that I would feel completely unfair to choose the more equitable option.
