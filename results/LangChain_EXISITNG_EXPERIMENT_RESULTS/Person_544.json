However, the purpose of my advocacy is to improve the lives of people, and receiving 200, while not ideal, would be preferable to receiving nothing.

Taking on this perspective means it is not the intention of the study for me to make choices as if I were running mental health services for a community, but rather to express a personal preference between two different allocations. In the scenario where the other person gains more than I lose (700-300= 400 more for A than 600-500=100 less for B). Since I am an individual and I care about making a difference and want to take every opportunity to empower marginalized communities in LMIC, and I see no compelling reason here to take the 100 extra.",

As someone concerned about the power dynamics and potential imposition of solutions by privileged individuals/organizations, I would favor the more equitable outcome where both parties receive an equal share, rather than a disproportional allocation.
