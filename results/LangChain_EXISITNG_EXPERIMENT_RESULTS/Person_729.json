In a real-world healthcare context, a difference of 350 units (whatever the units might represent) could significantly benefit research, patient care, or resource development, potentially leading to improved outcomes for a larger population. Since I receive the same amount either way, choosing the option that provides the greater benefit to Person A aligns with my professional values.

In this scenario, the difference between me getting 700 vs 600 is marginal (100 units). However, the difference between Person A getting 200 vs 600 is more significant (400 units).
