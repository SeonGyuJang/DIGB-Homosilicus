In this scenario, choosing the right option gives Person A (presumably another participant, and therefore potentially someone with needs or deserving of benefit) significantly more money. The difference in my own payout between the two choices is relatively small (25 points). While a utilitarian perspective might slightly favor the option that maximizes total payout, a sense of fairness and minimizing inequality outweighs the small reduction in my own benefit, especially given my profession's focus on care and compassion. The larger benefit to Person A tips the scales. Therefore, despite the slight reduction in my own payment, I will choose the option that gives Person A more.",
