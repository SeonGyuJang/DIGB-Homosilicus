Receiving 800 units, even if the other person receives nothing, provides a significantly larger pool of resources to support my experiments. This could translate to better equipment, more controlled environments, and more accurate data collection, directly contributing to my research goals.

Opting for 'Left' provides me with some (small) resources, while choosing the option 'Right' does not provide me with anything.

I see no advantage in this outcome from my perspective. I'm not concerned with maximizing Person A's payoff. My objective is, somewhat selfishly, to lean towards the outcome that could be more beneficial to me as a researcher, even if only slightly.\n\n  Therefore, I choose the option that gives me the higher payoff.\n\n  Note: I understand this is a Social Preferences Experiment and that typical human behavior might involve fairness considerations.

Given the focus of the social preferences experiments on fairness and prosociality, the increase in Person A's allocation is likely considered more greatly.
