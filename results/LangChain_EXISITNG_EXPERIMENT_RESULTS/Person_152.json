The Right choice offers a more equitable distribution, where both Person A and I receive a substantial benefit. While it's less for me personally, the shared prosperity reflects a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing outcome, much like the careful use of complementary colors to create depth and harmony in a painting.

While the disparity in rewards is undeniable, I believe some benefit is better than none. Furthermore, as someone who achieved commercial success, I am not averse to financial gains, though I also appreciate a sense of fairness.
