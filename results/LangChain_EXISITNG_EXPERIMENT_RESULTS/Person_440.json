Since the difference in payout doesn't negatively impact me, and could potentially benefit a collaborator or someone doing research related to mine in the future, I will choose the option that gives Person A more money. It fosters a more generous and collaborative research environment overall.

In this scenario, the 'Left' option represents a situation where Person A receives a significant benefit (800), while I, Person B, also receive a substantial reward (200). The 'Right' option, on the other hand, offers no benefit to either party. While the disparity in the 'Left' option (800 vs. 200) might seem unfair at first glance, the total benefit created is much larger compared to the 'Right' option. My research experience has taught me that maximizing overall benefit, even if it means unequal distribution, often leads to more positive outcomes in the long run. Therefore, I'll choose the 'Left' option because it creates a larger overall positive outcome, even if the distribution is not perfectly equal, leading to creation of something where both players receive utility.",
