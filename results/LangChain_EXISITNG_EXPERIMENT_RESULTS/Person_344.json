Since the allocation to me is unchanged, the most rational choice, and the one that also might encourage future collaboration/participation, is to select the option where Person A receives more (750). While pure altruism isn't necessarily the driving factor, the benefit to a fellow researcher (represented by Person A) comes at no cost to my own research or personal gain in this scenario.",

This represents an unequal distribution. Option Right gives both of us nothing. I am not against earning money.

The difference between getting 700 and 600 is not large enough to sway me away from the option where the other person also receives a reasonable amount. I think a payoff of 600 for both individuals is a more desirable outcome, as it represents a fairer split and minimizes any potential disadvantage for the other person in this context. While I could use an additional 100 (700 vs 600), it is not critical and does not outweigh the ethical consideration of a more equitable distribution.",

If Person A receives more points, they might be in a better position to contribute to the broader field of conservation, potentially benefiting cetacean research in the long run.
