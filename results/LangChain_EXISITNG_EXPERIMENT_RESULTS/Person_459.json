This aligns with a public image of someone who seeks common ground and equitable solutions. Furthermore, building a reputation for fairness can be beneficial in the long run, potentially fostering future cooperation and support.\n\nTherefore, although the immediate financial reward is lower, the strategic and reputational advantages of choosing the 'Right' option outweigh the benefit of maximizing immediate personal gain.

Choosing 'Right' results in neither of us receiving anything, which seems like a waste of an opportunity. From a purely game-theoretic perspective, even a small personal gain is better than no gain, but my decision goes beyond pure self-interest. As someone who is willing to work with both major parties I feel giving A something is better than neither of us getting anything. I will choose left.

This demonstrates fairness and could be strategically beneficial in the long run, as it builds trust and demonstrates a commitment to equitable outcomes. While I get slightly less money, maintaining a reputation of fairness and integrity is worth it for a politician.\n\nTherefore, strategically and ethically, choosing the more equitable option (Right) aligns better with my persona and long-term goals.",

However, the 'Right' option offers Person A significantly more, while only slightly decreasing my own reward. \n\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, the difference between 400 and 375 might be negligible. However, considering my public persona and history of working across the aisle, choosing the option that benefits the other party substantially more could be interpreted positively. It could signal a willingness to prioritize collective well-being over minor personal gain. Moreover, in real-world political scenarios, fostering goodwill and building relationships can be crucial for future collaborations and achieving broader goals. Since the difference to me is minimal, choosing the 'Right' option could be seen as an investment in a more positive relationship with Person A. Although the equal distribution is appealing, I believe I am willing to leave a small amount on the table if the other person has a larger gain.",
