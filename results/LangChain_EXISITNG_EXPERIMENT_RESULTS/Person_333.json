The difference in my personal gain (100) is less significant than the improvement in equity achieved by choosing 'Right'. My commitment to advancing scientific research and education stems from a desire to reduce disparities in care and improve outcomes for women. Choosing 'Right' aligns with this core value of promoting fairness and potentially contributing to a more equitable distribution of resources, even in this small experimental context.

Therefore, I will primarily consider maximizing the total resources available between us, which could potentially be used for charitable purposes.

In this context, Person A could represent a research grant, a healthcare initiative, or a direct aid program benefiting women affected by stroke. The additional 350 allocated to Person A could be used to fund critical research, provide essential medical care, or support educational programs that empower women to manage their stroke risk. Given my mission to improve the lives of women with stroke, prioritizing the option that provides significantly greater resources for relevant initiatives, even at a slight personal financial disadvantage, aligns with my values.
