While the disparity in rewards might initially seem unfair, my programming background pushes me to consider the overall efficiency and potential for future interactions (though this experiment is likely one-shot, considering it hypothetically). \n\nGiven the zero-sum nature of the 'Right' option, it offers no utility to anyone. While 'Left' presents a large inequality, it *does* offer a positive utility, albeit primarily to Person A. As a programmer, I'm often faced with situations where optimizing for a global objective requires accepting localized inefficiencies. While the distribution is heavily skewed towards A, choosing 'Left' still results in some value being created. Furthermore, choosing 'Left' promotes a potentially positive relationship with Person A (even though we may never meet), which aligns with pro-social behavior. Therefore, it is better to accept a small reward, even if accompanied by great inequality, than to destroy all value in the interaction for the both of us.\n",

The 'Right' option (600 for me, 600 for Person A) promotes a more equitable outcome, where both individuals receive a comparable amount.
