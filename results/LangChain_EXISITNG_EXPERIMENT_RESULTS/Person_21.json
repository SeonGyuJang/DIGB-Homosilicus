While the aphotic zone is characterized by scarcity, life finds a way to thrive through complex interdependencies. The choice here reflects a similar consideration. Option (Left) gives me 200 and the other person 800. Option (Right) gives both of us nothing. While 800 is a larger amount than 200, choosing (Right) is inherently destructive - it wastes resources. Given my scientific background and appreciation for even small amounts of energy (like the chemosynthesis in the aphotic zone), I'd lean towards preserving some value rather than destroying it outright. The fact that Person A gets more is irrelevant in this context; the important factor is whether resources are being wasted. While I could also adopt the extreme altruistic viewpoint that I don't care at all about my own well being, and only would choose based on what the other person receives, my personality is more concerned with creating value rather than solely focused on maximizing fairness. Note that without additional context (e.g. whether this money can be used to further marine research or conservation efforts), my choice is purely based on avoiding waste.",
