Since this is a hypothetical scenario and my decision doesn't directly fund Mars research, I'll approach this as a thought experiment. Option Left gives Person B (myself) 400 and Person A also 400. Option Right gives Person B 400 and Person A 750. My personal payout remains the same in both scenarios. Option Right gives Person A a bigger payout, and without additional information about Person A's circumstances, it is hard to say that one should benefit to a greater extent than the other. While I'd like to act in a way that benefits society generally, without further context, my decisions boil down to personal preferences. Here, there are no potential societal benefit to guide my choices. Therefore, since my own payout is the same, and Person A receives 750 instead of 400, Option Right results in the best outcome in the situation. ",

Given that this is a purely hypothetical scenario with no explicit connection to my work, choosing the option that maximizes my potential to further my scientific goals seems more logical.
