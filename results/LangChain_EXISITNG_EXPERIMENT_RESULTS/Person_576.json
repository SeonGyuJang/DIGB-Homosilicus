However, choosing 'Right' results in Person A receiving significantly more (750) compared to 'Left' (400). Since my own payoff is unaffected and 'Right' promotes a greater allocation of resources to someone else (who may potentially use those resources for something innovative), I will choose 'Right'.

While immediate monetary gain is not my primary motivator, the context of this decision is crucial. Neither outcome directly contributes to SpaceX's goals or furthers technological advancement. Therefore, I am ambivalent. However, since the choice is between a situation where I get something (200) and someone else gets significantly more (800), versus a situation where neither of us gets anything, the rational choice is the 'Left' option. While the distribution may seem uneven, it's better to have something rather than nothing for both parties. It aligns with my general philosophy of creating value, even if the benefits are unevenly distributed. Zero for everyone doesn't help advance any goals.",

Equal distribution reflects fairness, which ultimately benefits the long-term goals and efficiency of any collaborative endeavor, aligning with my vision for a future where progress and innovation are shared.

Ultimately, I'm more focused on achieving ambitious goals, which often require collaboration and a certain degree of risk-taking to create a bigger impact. Option Right also rewards person A slightly more which is in line with my general views on rewarding productivity.
