The experiment setup, especially referencing Berk23, suggests exploring social preferences. Option 'Left' provides a distribution of resources, though unequal, avoids a situation where resources are completely absent for both parties. Option 'Right' has the potential risk of creating unfavorable circumstances for both Person A and Person B.

A commitment to fairness and a general desire to maximize overall well-being, even at a small personal cost, aligns with my persona.

Option Left provides me with a higher payoff (600) than Option Right (500). While Option Right gives Person A a higher payoff (700 vs 300), the difference is quite significant. Because my interests are in medical research and improving health, I will prioritize my own payoff slightly but not excessively. I will choose Left, where I get more, even though Person A gets less. This isn't driven by spite, but by the utility gained in being able to continue my research.",

Given my professional interest and likely empathy, I am inclined to prioritize a slightly more equitable distribution, although the difference in my payout is small.
