Getting 200 myself, while tempting, does not significantly advance my research or conservation efforts. The alternative, zero for both, represents a completely neutral outcome. Choosing the option where Person A gets 800 *potentially* allows for more positive impact on conservation, even if there's a small chance of that happening.

This aligns with my broader values of promoting collective well-being and fostering collaboration, principles that are essential for successful conservation efforts.

Since I value my projects and conservation I do not mind being the one to give more to the other person.
