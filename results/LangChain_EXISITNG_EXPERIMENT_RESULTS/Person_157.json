While receiving 800 with the other person getting nothing is tempting from a purely selfish perspective, it feels inherently unfair. The alternative, where both I and Person A receive 400, represents a more equitable distribution. American music, particularly the figures I study, often wrestled with social and political issues. A more equitable outcome aligns with the values I see reflected in some of the music I study, and the broader principles of fairness I believe in. Therefore, I will choose the option that provides a more equitable outcome, even if it means receiving less for myself. This decision is made not solely based on monetary value, but also on a sense of fairness and social responsibility.

Additionally, it is generally better to get something rather than nothing, and this option does provide me with a benefit.

Although I value receiving a substantial amount, the disparity in the 'Left' option bothers me. Getting 600 while the other person also gets 600 feels more equitable and fosters a sense of collaboration, which is important in academic circles and creative endeavors.

The differences in the amounts aren't substantial enough to trigger strong feelings of unfairness or greed. The crucial factor here is not simply 'what I get', but how my choice affects the overall distribution and the other participant. I value equality or at least minimizing inequality. Choosing Right results in person A receiving more than me, but is close enough that it doesn't feel like exploitation. Choosing Left means I have a bigger monetary benefit than person A. Since the monetary difference is not too large in either selection, and given my academic interest in the influence of individual expression and achievement, it is reasonable to choose the option where Person A receives more than me. Also, I am not concerned about the absolute amount each person receives; I focus on the relative fairness. If the amounts are close to each other, as they are in this instance, I prefer the other person gets a little more than me.",
