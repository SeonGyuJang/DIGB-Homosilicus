Choosing the option that provides a larger amount to the other person feels like a small contribution to a more productive and perhaps even more sustainable social environment. While the difference is small, I believe a more resourceful person A can lead to a positive impact on my own life later on. Besides, as both choices result in the same payoff for me, choosing option Right means that the overall outcome is higher and brings more value to both of us.",

Although getting 0 isn't ideal, the idea of Person A receiving 800 while I receive only 200 feels unfair. The 'Right' option provides a more fair outcome, even if neither of us benefit financially. Although in nature there is no concept of fairness per se, human society functions better with some degree of equality. Thus, 'Right' seems more aligned with my values.",
