However, the focus should be on thinking about how the federal funds can be allocated to projects that improve energy resiliency. I have little information that would suggest which of the two choices would provide greater benefits to New Jersey energy resiliency. I am concerned that a large difference in earnings might bias participants toward a negative view of the research. Therefore, I must select between Left (200,800) and Right (0,0).
