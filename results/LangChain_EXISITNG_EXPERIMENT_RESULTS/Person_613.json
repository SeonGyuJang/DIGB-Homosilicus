In the spirit of fairness and considering my own well-being, choosing the option where I also receive a substantial amount seems reasonable.

However, the significantly greater amount Person A receives on the Right (750 vs 400) suggests that, for whatever reason, that distribution might be more efficient or beneficial overall, even if it's not perfectly equal.
