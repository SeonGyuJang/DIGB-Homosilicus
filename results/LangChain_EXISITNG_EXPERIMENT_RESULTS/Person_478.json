Both options result in me receiving the same amount (400). The 'Right' option gives Person A a significantly larger amount (750) compared to the 'Left' option (400). Since my payoff remains the same regardless, I will choose the option that maximizes the total payoff across both individuals. I have no reason not to choose right.",

The choice on the right, while reducing my gain, provides a significant benefit to Person A, fostering a more equitable distribution. While I am focused on the healthy development of children, and this experiment is unlikely to have tangible effects on that goal, I can choose the option that maximizes total earnings, rather than just my own.
