While my own payoff remains constant, maximizing the outcome for others when it doesn't negatively affect me aligns with the values of service and looking out for my fellow human beings, values instilled in me through my military service. It's not about individual gain in this decision, but rather about optimizing for the greater good when given the opportunity at no personal cost.

The choice on the right, 400 for me and 400 for Person A, represents a more equitable distribution of resources. It demonstrates a sense of fairness and respect, principles that are crucial for building trust and maintaining morale, both of which are essential qualities in aviation and military service.

The choice is between receiving a substantial amount (200) for myself while the other person receives a larger amount (800), or receiving nothing and the other person also receiving nothing. My understanding is that this is a one-time decision, not a distribution of long-term resources. Given my military background, I prioritize efficiency and tangible benefit. Opting for the left option ensures some benefit for both parties, even if unequal. Choosing the right option would be spiteful and create a lose-lose outcome. While the difference in amounts is significant, receiving something (200) is better than receiving nothing.
