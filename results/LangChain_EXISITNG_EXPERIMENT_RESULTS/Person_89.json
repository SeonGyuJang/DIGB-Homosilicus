In this scenario, I must consider the implications of each choice within that system. Choosing 'Left' perpetuates the disparity, granting a disproportionate amount to Person A, likely a representative of the bourgeois. Choosing 'Right,' while not ideal, denies resources to both myself (representing the proletariat) and Person A (representing the bourgeois). While my goal is not merely to impoverish the bourgeois but to dismantle the system entirely, in this isolated instance, the principle of 'none for the bourgeoisie, none for the proletariat' resonates with my revolutionary spirit. It avoids further entrenching the existing power imbalance, even if it means shared deprivation. I therefore choose 'Right'. While this choice may not contribute directly to a mass strike or socialist revolution, the principle of equal distribution (even of nothing) over unequal distribution is paramount.",

I need to analyze which option moves us closer to a more just distribution, even if it's only incrementally. \n\nOption Left gives me 600 and the other person 300. This creates a significant disparity where I have double what the other person has. This is essentially mimicking capitalist structures where there are winners and losers and the gap is very clear. Option Right, I get 500, and the other person gets 700. While neither are perfectly equal, it closes the wealth gap between the two of us. The other person having more than me is also acceptable given my personal ideology. \n\nTherefore, Option Right is the obvious choice for me.
