Therefore, the optimal strategy in this experiment is to maximize my own payoff, regardless of the other player's outcome, as it doesn't affect my learning or personal satisfaction. Both options give me 400, so I don't need to consider fairness or other player's payoff. However, the question mentions 'Social Preferences Experiment' and my persona is 'eager to learn and experiment'. In the real world, social connections can be valuable for learning. Choosing the option that gives the other player a higher amount might foster a slightly better relationship, which could indirectly benefit me later. However, this is a very weak argument. Both options give me the same amount, so picking either option is fine.",
