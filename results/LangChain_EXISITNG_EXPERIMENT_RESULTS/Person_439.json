Both choices provide me with the same amount of money (400). However, the 'Right' choice gives Person A a significantly higher payout (750) compared to the 'Left' choice (400). Since my own outcome is unaffected, and the 'Right' choice benefits Person A more, choosing the 'Right' option aligns with my values of love, justice, and promoting the well-being of others. The slightly higher payout for Person A would also be consistent with a transnational interest in justice and human rights, as it shows a desire to help others, without negatively affecting myself.
