The deep ocean is already a vulnerable environment, and climate change is likely to exacerbate the threats it faces. While the immediate monetary gain in this scenario is small compared to the scale of the problems facing deep-sea ecosystems, the choice embodies a principle. Choosing 'Left' means participating in a system, even if imperfect, where resource allocation occurs. Choosing 'Right' destroys value for both parties, which is counterproductive. While I would prefer a more equitable distribution, receiving something is better than receiving nothing, and the fact that Person A receives more is irrelevant to my overall goal of fostering resourcefulness and proactive solutions for environmental challenges.

Although I am also aware of the potential social signalling implications if I appear completely selfish. The difference between me getting 600 and 500 is slightly more significant to me than the difference between the other person getting 300 and 700, purely from a financial perspective. Therefore, I'll prioritize my slightly larger personal benefit, whilst acknowledging the potential social signal.
