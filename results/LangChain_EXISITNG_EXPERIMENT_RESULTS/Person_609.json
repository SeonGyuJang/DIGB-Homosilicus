While electricians are often associated with safety and responsibility, those traits don't necessarily push me towards one choice over the other in this purely distributive scenario. The risk and hazard concerns that the prompt references also are irrelevant, because the prompt is purely about money.\n\n  The right choice offers a more equitable outcome. While I'd prefer 800 for myself, the difference isn't significant enough to justify Person A getting absolutely nothing. A more equitable distribution feels like the right thing to do, particularly since it only costs me 400 to make Person A also receive 400. Therefore, I'll choose the right option.",
