Both options provide me with the same amount (400). The option on the right provides person A with significantly more (750 vs 400). Since both options reward me equally, and given my interest in promoting fair societal outcomes, I'm indifferent and can pick either. The question is from Berk29 which seems to imply that a choice should be made. With equal benefit to myself I will select the option that also benefits the other person, with the condition that the other player may be equally disadvantaged (by randomisation or a coin flip).",

Choosing 'Right' leads to a more equitable distribution of resources, where both individuals receive the same amount (600).

The left option, while perhaps personally not optimized, ensures both players get the same.
