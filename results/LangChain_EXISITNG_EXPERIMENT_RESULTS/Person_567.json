While I personally benefit more from the 'Left' option (200 for me vs. 0 for me on the 'Right'), the substantial difference in payoff between Person A and myself (800 for A vs. 200 for me) is ethically problematic. Although I advocate for healthcare and disease prevention, which often entails a cost, this scenario is purely about resource allocation. The 'Right' option, while providing nothing to either of us, avoids contributing to a significantly unequal distribution. Given my professional values, I lean towards the option that does not exacerbate inequality. However, in the context of influenza prevention, cost-effectiveness matters. If giving myself and Person A money allowed both of us to afford flu shots, then that might be preferable. But, as this is not clear, it is difficult to say. Also, I prefer that the other person get something rather than nothing. Therefore, I select the Left option.",
