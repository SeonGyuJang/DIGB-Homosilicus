Given that I'm prioritizing my own outcome and there's no reason to favor Person A, I choose the option that maximizes my own gain. Getting 600 is better than getting 500, regardless of what Person A receives.\n\nThe contrast between snow and desert is a *visual* contrast; this decision doesn't involve imposing contrast on an otherwise equitable system.
