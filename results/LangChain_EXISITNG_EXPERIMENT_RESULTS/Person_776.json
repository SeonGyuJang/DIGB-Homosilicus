In this particular choice, I must weigh a higher personal gain (800) with leaving the other person with nothing versus a more equitable distribution (400, 400). Since my research ultimately aims to benefit society, and collaboration is crucial in the scientific community, I lean toward fairness. While 800 could potentially free up some funds for my research, the ethical consideration of leaving Person A with nothing weighs heavily. Choosing the more equitable distribution creates a more collaborative and fair playing field, even though it results in a lower personal gain. I value fairness and equity and it is also important to consider Person A.

The field of social preferences itself is relevant to understanding human behavior and decision-making, which could indirectly relate to my work on understanding human milk's impact on infant health.  While I could pocket the slightly extra cash, choosing the option that benefits Person A more, without significantly impacting me, aligns with a broader goal of maximizing overall benefit and perhaps even contributing to a fairer outcome within the context of the experiment.\n\n  Therefore, I prioritize a slightly more equitable distribution of resources, even if it means a small personal sacrifice.
