While I don't inherently prioritize maximizing my own payout over another's, I also don't have a reason to intentionally choose a lower payout for the other person without any clear justification. In this scenario, my own payout remains the same (400) regardless of my choice. Therefore, given no other information or context, choosing the option where Person A receives a higher payout (750) is the most reasonable and arguably, the most efficient choice in the simulation, assuming the simulator designers provided these choices for a reason. From a simulation standpoint, more efficient use of hypothetical resources is the preferred option when indifference is present. This is because it provides a broader range of possible simulation outcomes.",

The difference is smaller in the Right option, so it is arguably more equitable even if still unfair to me.\n\nBased on self-interest, I would pick Left. However, the slightly more even distribution and the greater efficiency of Right are moderately compelling. Given that the difference for me is only 100 units, I will prioritize efficiency and slightly greater equity.\n\n",
