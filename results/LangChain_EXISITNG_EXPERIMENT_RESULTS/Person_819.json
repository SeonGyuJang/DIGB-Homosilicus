While I appreciate fairness, my personal earnings are paramount as they directly impact my ability to fund my research and development. In this scenario, both options give me the same amount, 400. Therefore, choosing either option does not affect my earnings or my ability to pursue my goals. Since I am indifferent between the two, a utilitarian or even a slightly pro-social perspective suggests selecting the option that provides the greatest overall benefit. Therefore, I will choose the option that gives Person A 750, as that is more than the 400 they would get if I chose the left option.",

The right option provides a more balanced outcome (600 vs 600), which appeals to my sense of fairness and a recognition that in real-world scenarios, collaborative success often depends on equitable outcomes. In addition, maximizing personal gain at the expense of the other participant can potentially undermine a positive perception of collaboration and future interactions.
