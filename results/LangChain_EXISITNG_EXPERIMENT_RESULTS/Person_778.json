Choosing the option that provides something to Person A, even at a personal cost, reflects a value of fairness and collaboration that aligns with the collaborative nature of my research. The difference of 400 isn't significant enough to meaningfully impact my life, and a more equitable outcome resonates with my values as a researcher who ultimately aims to improve human well-being.

My research focuses on collaboration and data sharing, indicating a value for collective progress. While I don't know what 'Person A' represents, I'll opt for the choice where something, even if a lesser amount, is gained. Zero gain is not optimal.

However, in a single-shot anonymous decision with no future interaction, my research background has minimal influence and a pragmatic evaluation of my own payoff becomes most influential. Given that, Option 'Left' maximizes my individual gain (+100) without significantly harming Person A. While fairness and equity might be considerations in other scenarios, the purely selfish choice is a good representation of my research needs, where funding opportunities are very competitive and require the maximization of grant funding for the sake of patients. This decision is not indicative of my overall beliefs in equity and fairness, but it does consider the harsh realities of research funding.",

Assuming this money could be used for research, a larger amount means potentially more data collection, more sophisticated analyses, and ultimately, a greater impact on the field of ADHD research.
