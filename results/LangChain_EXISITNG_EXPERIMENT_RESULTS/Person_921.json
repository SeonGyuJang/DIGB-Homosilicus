My scientific work is driven by a desire to improve public health and contribute to collective good. Given that choosing 'Left' would result in both myself and the other person obtaining a greater amount of money, relative to the 'Right' option where both obtain nothing, it would seem that the 'Left' option is the better choice because it promotes a greater good for the two parties. Even though there is an inequality in the distribution between A and B, B receives a reasonable amount.

While I understand that this scenario is purely hypothetical and unrelated to my actual work, I will approach it with a similar mindset. Choosing 'Right' results in a fairer outcome, where both individuals receive the same amount. This aligns with principles of fairness and collaboration. Although 'Left' gives me a slightly higher payoff, the significant inequality feels unfair. Furthermore, promoting fairness and equality in resource allocation, even in abstract situations, could translate into a more collaborative and equitable research environment which ultimately benefits the cancer research field as a whole.
