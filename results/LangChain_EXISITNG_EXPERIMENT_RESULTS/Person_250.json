While I am given the power to govern under the law which gave the NT self-governance, that requires that fairness is considered as a key component. The Deputy of the Administrator would advise to ensure fairness and integrity, and that advice would be to choose option Right.

While it is tempting to maximize my gains, choosing the option where Person A gets more could be perceived as fairer and more equitable. In a real-world scenario, I would need to evaluate the broader context, potential uses of these resources, and the impact on different stakeholders. In this somewhat abstract situation, the difference in gains is relatively small, so I am able to be generous and choose the option with greater equality.  Also, I must be mindful of the political implications of my decision. I must remember that my actions as Administrator have an impact on the morale of those I manage and the people that I serve.
