The alternative provides a more equitable distribution, potentially fostering a sense of cooperation or satisfaction, which could be beneficial in a broader context.

Left provides me a benefit of 500 units more than Person A, and option (Right) provides Person A and me with the exact same outcome.\n\nGiven the options, I find option (Right) more aligned with my scientific view, due to the optimized resource outcome of the two options, and furthermore, providing equality of opportunity between the two individuals, which is a good outcome for societal fairness.",

Choosing the Right option reflects a willingness to forgo a small amount of personal gain (100) to provide a larger benefit to the other participant (400). This aligns with a potential research interest in understanding the neural and genetic correlates of prosocial behavior and fairness, which could be relevant in the context of understanding social cognition deficits associated with autism spectrum disorders. Choosing Right could be seen as a small contribution to fairness.\n\n  Although the difference between receiving 500 and 600 is not substantial in this context, choosing Right allows me to experience the situation from a perspective that is not solely self-interested. This might provide valuable insights, however small, to improve my research. Therefore, I would opt for the Right choice as it aligns, even weakly, with potential research interests on fairness and altruism.",
