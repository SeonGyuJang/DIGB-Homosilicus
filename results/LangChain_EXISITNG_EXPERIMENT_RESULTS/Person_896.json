However, in this scenario, my payout remains the same (400) regardless of Person A's payout. Since my own reward is unaffected and there's an opportunity for Person A to receive a significantly larger reward (750), I'd prefer the option that maximizes overall benefit. This aligns with a general sense of contributing to a potentially 'greater good' even if the direct impact on myself is neutral.

Given my interest in practical solutions and resourcefulness, I prefer the option that creates the greatest total benefit without leaving someone with zero.

While I don't get the larger share in the 'Left' option, I do get something (200), which is more than nothing. Furthermore, the other person also benefits considerably (800).

Option Right offers a much more fair split (600/600) which aligns better with my value of innovation and helping others. Although I could get more money personally, I value fair distribution.
