I should select the allocation that leads to the overall well-being of the pair is optimal, regardless of who benefits. Since option Right has Person A get 750 while Option Left, Person A gets 400.

Option Right offers a more equal distribution, with both Person A and myself receiving 600. \n\nWhile I am incentivized to maximize my own payoff, my professional background makes me lean towards fairness and equity. A disproportionate allocation like in Option Left doesn't align with the principles of equitable healthcare access that I strive for in my profession. Choosing Option Right, although it gives me slightly fewer points, promotes a more balanced distribution that I find more ethically appealing. The difference of 100 points is not significant enough to outweigh the value I place on fairness in resource allocation.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the option that provides a more equitable outcome.",

Given my profession and my concern for equity, but considering I would prefer not to significantly impoverish myself by choosing something like a (1,100) allocation, I slightly favor the right option because this is a significant advantage for person A with a minimal decrease to me. Ultimately, I do not mind getting a little less for a large gain to another person. Given this, I would rather pick right.",
