Since the 'Right' option provides more to Person A (750 vs 400), and this doesn't affect me negatively, I should choose 'Right' to maximize the total amount of resources given out, potentially furthering overall welfare, which could indirectly benefit environmental causes. There is no stated cost or tradeoff from Person A getting more. If this were a real scenario in my field, I'd be looking for ways to maximize resource allocation for environmental projects.",

While the distribution isn't perfectly equal, choosing 'Left' creates significantly more overall value. My research is funded with the expectation of contributing to society, and choosing 'Left', despite the inequity, ultimately aligns more closely with that expectation by creating a larger positive outcome, which, in the long run, could enable me to obtain further funding for eco-drone research and applications.\n\nChoosing 'Right', while seemingly 'fair' in its equal distribution of nothing, actively destroys potential value. This is inconsistent with my values as an advocate for using technology to improve environmental monitoring and create beneficial outcomes.\n\nTherefore, I prioritize the creation of value, even if the distribution is skewed, and choose the 'Left' option.\n",
