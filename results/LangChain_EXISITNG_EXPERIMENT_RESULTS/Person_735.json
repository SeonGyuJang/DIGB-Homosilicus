Since I am already receiving a decent amount, and my professional values prioritize helping others, I would choose the option that significantly benefits another person, even if it doesn't increase my own immediate gain.

Although my personal gain is reduced, distributing resources equally feels more ethically sound and contributes to a sense of fairness that's important for public health initiatives and cooperation.

Although it creates an inequality, the overall benefit to society (especially if Person A might use that money for beneficial purposes related to health or development) is likely greater than if both of us receive nothing. My research emphasizes the importance of resource allocation for optimal outcomes, and in this scenario, the left option leads to a greater total 'wealth' that *could* contribute indirectly to the fight against malaria if Person A chooses to use it in a way that helps.
