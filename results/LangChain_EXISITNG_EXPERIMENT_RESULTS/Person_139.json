Choosing the right option provides significantly more resources in total. While the scenario is abstract, I can apply the same underlying principles. The increased allocation to person A could, theoretically, be utilized to support programs relevant to preventing global pandemics, improving health, increasing research, innovation and resilience against pandemics. Ultimately this choice benefits the community. Considering my values and the scenario I would choose the right.

Even though 'Left' allocates a larger portion to Person A (800) than to me (200), this allocation is significantly better than both receiving nothing. Pandemics have immense economic repercussions and thus I need to consider the potential impacts of my decision from a public health perspective. Choosing 'Left' is therefore the most rational decision to maximise the total resources available, which in turn can be allocated toward pandemic prevention. Furthermore, resilient health systems require resource inputs. Choosing left ensures that resources are available.
