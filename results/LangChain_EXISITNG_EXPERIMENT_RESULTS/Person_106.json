Choosing the right option benefits Person A more. Since I don't feel particularly altruistic towards Person A, and my own outcome remains the same, I don't see a compelling reason to favor the right option. The left option seems slightly preferable as it denies extra benefit to Person A, which aligns with my general view that autonomous systems should be approached with caution and may even need disabling.",

Seeing the other person receive a significantly larger sum (800) might be perceived as an unfavorable outcome, even though I receive 200. My character's focus on 'disabling' and 'hacking' leans towards a preference for a less palatable but more equal outcome. Therefore, I'll choose the option where both receive zero.\n\nThis choice aligns with a preference for fairness, albeit a somewhat destructive fairness, driven by a character that has inherent dislike for systems where they are at odds, even when there's something to be gained.",

Option (Left) gives me more, and the other person less, but option (Right) involves me getting less in exchange for A getting a larger amount of money. Given my professional goals, there is no reason to give A more money for any purpose as there is no positive externality for me here and I derive some utility from getting 100 more and Person A getting 400 less.
