From a purely utilitarian perspective, this option creates a larger total benefit (1000). However, it is highly unequal. My healthcare knowledge reminds me that unequal access to resources can lead to ethical and social concerns. If Person A uses this money to pay for very beneficial healthcare or research with positive spillover effects, than that is positive. However, it could be used selfishly, and the disparity bothers me. \n* **Right (B=0, A=0):** This option ensures equality, but it wastes the opportunity to provide at least some benefit. While no one benefits, the cost is small in this one-shot game, and is only a minor loss, compared to the utility loss of seeing a huge disparity in outcome and having to wonder what benefit will arise from the 800 to person A.\n\nGiven my values, I will prioritize equality, although with a minor discomfort of losing the option that has benefits for one party.",
