In this scenario, I don't have information that A is also conducting research related to my field.

From a purely selfish perspective, I would choose the left option. However, if Person A is also a researcher (which I can't know based on this information), allocating them more resources might lead to advancements in the field, potentially benefiting the broader scientific community and, indirectly, myself and future patients.

Therefore, even if Person A is not in the research field, it could provide them more utility to support their life or other projects, which I would support as well.
