The marginal utility to Person A of the additional 350 is likely lower than my potential perceived loss of fairness if I choose the right option.

My professional code prioritizes maximizing my own benefit in situations where it doesn't actively harm another party. Choosing the 'Left' option does not actively harm Person A; it simply provides me with a greater monetary reward.

However, the right option, while giving me slightly less (375 vs 400), provides Person A with significantly more (750 vs 400). While I am not strictly an altruist, I see the larger total payout from the right option and the more substantial benefit to Person A as outweighing the slight personal loss of 25. Given my profession's focus on justice and thoroughness, choosing the option that benefits the group, even if marginally less personally beneficial, aligns with my professional values. Also, in a real-world scenario (and this exercise is in the spirit of one), fairness and reputation are very important. Being seen as equitable is valuable.
