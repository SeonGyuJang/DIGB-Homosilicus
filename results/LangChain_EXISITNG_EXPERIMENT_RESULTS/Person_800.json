Choosing the 'Right' option, where Person A receives 700 and I receive 500, results in a greater total benefit (1200) compared to the 'Left' option (900). Although it means I receive less, the significant increase for Person A outweighs my personal loss, especially if Person A represents someone directly involved in the fight against yaws or a community member. Since the eradication effort requires collective action and support, the small personal sacrifice is justified by the overall improvement for the community. It's possible that Person A is struggling more than me; therefore it is reasonable to contribute toward A's well being. If I were to focus solely on my own outcome I would take the left option and while that could be defended as optimal I consider the overall impact to be more relevant.",

While equal distribution is generally desirable, in resource-constrained environments, achieving the most significant impact with the available resources is paramount. In this scenario, choosing the right option allows Person A to receive almost twice as much as what they would receive choosing the left option. Since Person A represents another entity/group involved in the eradication of yaws, it is crucial to ensure they have sufficient resources to maximize the positive impact on the affected communities. Receiving an additional 350 will improve the chances of a successful eradication. Therefore, while I would receive slightly less personally, I believe allocating more resources towards the eradication efforts is the morally responsible and efficient choice. It's worth noting that the difference in my payoff between the two choices is only 25, therefore prioritizing overall impact is paramount.",
