In this scenario, I have two options that both benefit me equally, providing a solid base for my own musical pursuits. The difference lies in what the other person (Person A) receives. The 'Right' choice gives Person A significantly more (750) than the 'Left' choice (400). While I don't inherently need Person A's resources for my blues work, the principle of maximizing overall well-being, especially when it comes at no cost to myself, leans towards the 'Right' option. While perfect equality would be preferable, an equitable outcome, where the other party significantly benefits, is acceptable. My music often tells stories of resilience and hardship; choosing to maximize the well-being of others resonates with those themes.",

While receiving 800 is tempting, the option to share equally with Person A aligns better with my artistic values of creating a cohesive and dynamic performance. Blues music is often about call and response, a form of sharing and interplay. Choosing the right option allows for a sense of mutual benefit, reminiscent of a blues jam session where everyone contributes and benefits from the shared musical experience.

The 'Right' option, resulting in 0 for both players, leads to no resources at all. While it may be tempting to punish a perceived unequal distribution, I believe that having something is better than nothing. The blues, at its heart, is about making the most of what you have and finding a way to survive and thrive, even in difficult circumstances. 200 is a start; zero is nothing.",

In this scenario, the right choice offers a more balanced outcome, even though I would receive a little less money. The 'call and response' here is between my self-interest and my sense of fairness. It feels ethically correct to choose the option where both individuals receive the same amount, promoting a sense of equality and shared benefit. Choosing the left option would lead to me having a more dominant and slightly selfish position, something I would not want to endorse, while the right option would promote fairness.
