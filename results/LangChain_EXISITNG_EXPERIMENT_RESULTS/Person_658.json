Furthermore, I do not see any significant harm to myself by taking a slightly smaller amount. While I don't derive utility from inequality per se, the relatively small personal cost makes choosing the option that benefits the other person more acceptable, especially given the potential, albeit small, long-term benefits that could arise.
