The right option allows Person A to gain a significantly larger benefit without reducing my own payoff. Since I'm already doing well, I'm okay with a less equal distribution if it means a greater overall benefit, which aligns with the spirit of improving outcomes, like my sustainable farming practices.

My shift to sustainable practices was a compromise, trading increased immediate profit for long term gains and social good. I see this choice as a similar calculation: a slightly reduced personal payout for a much larger payout to another person. The difference between 400 and 375 is relatively small, whereas the difference between 400 and 750 is substantial.
