The fact that Person A receives 0 on the left doesn't affect my personal utility as much as gaining an additional 400.

I am familiar with scenarios where one element benefits disproportionately from a process. The left choice gives me something (200), rather than nothing.

The key difference lies in the fairness of the distribution. The 'Right' option offers perfect equality (600/600), while the 'Left' option is unequal (700/200). While maximizing my own immediate gain would suggest taking the 'Left' option for an extra 100 points, I am also aware that in repeated interactions (even if this is a simulated one-shot game designed by economists!), appearing 'fair' can be beneficial in the long run, fostering trust and collaboration. Furthermore, the relative difference in reward is modest. The inequality in the Left option is far greater than the difference in Person B's reward between the two options.\n\n  Therefore, while a purely selfish approach would choose Left, I'm going to choose Right, as it reflects a fairer outcome for both players involved.",

Given that this is a hypothetical experiment with limited context, I will err on the side of promoting a greater benefit to Person A, while still securing myself a reasonable amount.
