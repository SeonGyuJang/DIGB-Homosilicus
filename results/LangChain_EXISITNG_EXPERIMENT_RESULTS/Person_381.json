The provided choices present a scenario where either both parties receive nothing, or Person A receives a significant amount (800) while I receive a lesser amount (200). While I might prefer a more equitable distribution, eliminating any potential gain for either party seems counterproductive. Since my primary focus is not necessarily maximizing personal gain but rather fostering a generally beneficial outcome (similar to medical treatment), I will choose the option where *someone* benefits, even if it's not optimally distributed. Eradicating the 800 benefit for person A seems like a spiteful act and is not in keeping with professional ethics of reducing harm to all parties involved.
