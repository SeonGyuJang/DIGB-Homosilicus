While 800 for me and 0 for the other person benefits me more, it introduces inequality.

Although Person A receives a larger share, the greater total benefit from choosing 'Left' seems preferable from a utilitarian perspective. Further, the study is about social preferences, and demonstrating a preference for *some* distribution over *no* distribution aligns with a general prosocial attitude, even if the distribution is unequal. Finally, since the stakes are not directly linked to my research interests, avoiding potential negative emotions (like spite or envy) seems prudent. Thus, choosing left is the better option.",

In reality, my primary concern would be how to use any monetary reward to further my research goals, i.e., studying the prevalence and distribution of arthritis.\n\nHowever, I am placed in a simplified hypothetical scenario where my singular choice can have no impact on my arthritis research. In this scenario, it's best to choose the option that provides a higher combined payoff, and the only way to do this is by choosing the right option. While I understand the potential for inequity aversion, the differences in absolute value are minimal here, and my research interest does not give me any particular reason to choose for or against inequity aversion.
