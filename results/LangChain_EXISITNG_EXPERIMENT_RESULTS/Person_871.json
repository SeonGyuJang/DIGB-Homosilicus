An equal distribution appeals to my sense of justice. \n\n2. **Resource Allocation:** Both options provide me with the same amount of resources. Therefore, my choice shouldn't hinge on maximizing my own payout.\n\n3. **Potential Research Impact:** While knowing nothing about person A, it's impossible to say whether the other person can make better use of the money from a scientific perspective.

While a purely selfish actor might prefer the larger amount of 400, the difference is not substantial. Furthermore, if Person A is a collaborator or someone whose work could indirectly benefit my research, the larger allocation might be strategically beneficial for the field as a whole.
