The Right option, on the other hand, provides a more equitable distribution of resources, with both parties receiving 400. Although I could benefit personally from the left choice, I am biased towards improving student outcomes, which would likely lead to a more egalitarian world. The 'Right' choice, therefore, seems more aligned with my values of fairness and equity, especially considering that both options provide something, but 'Left' gives me more.

In the 'Right' option, no one gets anything, which is a less desirable outcome from an optimization perspective. While the disparity between Person A and Person B is large in the 'Left' option, it's still better than a scenario where both individuals receive nothing.

My experience with programs like No Child Left Behind and the Smarter Balanced Assessment System has instilled in me the importance of addressing achievement gaps and fostering a sense of collective progress. Choosing (Right), while yielding a slightly lower individual gain, ensures a fairer distribution of resources and embodies my commitment to equitable outcomes.

In this scenario, Option Right gives Person A a significantly higher benefit. Even though I receive a slightly lower amount, the overall pot of available payment increases. Considering my experience implementing support programs and analyzing data to identify areas of need, I realize the importance of considering the bigger picture and the potential impact of my choices on others.

The Right option gives Person A nearly double what I receive (750 vs 375). While I appreciate fairness, the significant increase in Person A's allocation in the Right option is substantial. Given my experience implementing support programs and analyzing data to identify areas of need, I understand that sometimes unequal distribution can lead to better overall outcomes. In this case, perhaps Person A has a greater need or has contributed more. While a purely selfish choice might favor the Left, my background in education encourages me to consider the broader impact. However, in the absence of any information about the needs and contributions of person A, there is no reason to take significantly less than them. Therefore I choose the Left.",
