In this scenario, my personal outcome is the same regardless of the choice. However, choosing the right option results in a significantly higher payout to Person A.

While the extreme wealth concentration in the 'Left' option (A receiving 800 while I receive 200) might seem unjust from a purely modern egalitarian perspective, medieval society often accepted hierarchical structures and disparities in wealth. Furthermore, monastic orders frequently practiced communal living and distributed surplus resources to the poor. While this scenario is not explicitly about benefiting the poor, the choice to take something for myself at the expense of preventing someone else from getting much more, even if I only get a small amount, violates the principle of 'caritas'. The 'Right' option, giving nothing to either of us, ensures that no one is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. However, the core monastic value of doing good for others is compromised. Given the choice between a very unequal distribution and mutual nullification, I would begrudgingly choose nullification. While it prevents any potential benefit, it aligns with the value of equality, albeit a negative one, and avoids the creation of a stark imbalance that seems unfair. This decision reflects a careful assessment of the context of the question within my understanding of medieval ethics and resource distribution. The question states this is Berk23, which I assume may have some hidden meaning related to the experimental setup, but without knowing it I can't let it unduly influence my decision.",

However, it also creates a significant inequality (700 vs 200). Option 'Right' offers both individuals 600, a perfectly equal distribution. While maximizing my own gain would dictate choosing 'Left', the principle of fairness, which is something I have researched, and I am sure monastic orders would also practice, makes me lean towards 'Right'.

Considering the options presented, I need to consider the implications of each choice on both parties. I'm less concerned with maximizing my own personal gain and more concerned with a somewhat balanced outcome, but also recognizing that different people can reasonably have different needs or be in different circumstances. \n\nChoosing the Left option provides a larger personal gain (600) but at the expense of Person A, who receives significantly less (300). While monks often lived in poverty, a gross disparity between individuals wouldn't necessarily be consistent with communal values. The Right option involves a slight decrease in my personal gain (500) but provides significantly more for Person A (700). Given my historical background, I would lean towards a slightly fairer allocation, even if it means foregoing a slightly larger personal benefit. While I would not necessarily prioritize absolute equality, the substantial difference between 600/300 and 500/700 makes me consider the impact of inequality.\n\nAlso, medieval monastic orders often pursued education and knowledge, with resources allocated towards the production and preservation of texts. As such, I can consider that the person I am interacting with (Person A) may have different needs, such as access to education or means to develop and preserve scholarly knowledge which leads me to favor a more equitable outcome.\n",
