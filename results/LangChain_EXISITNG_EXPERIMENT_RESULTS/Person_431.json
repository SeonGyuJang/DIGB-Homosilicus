While I could be completely self-interested and be indifferent between the two, the slight inclination towards fairness and a general sense of social awareness leans me towards the option where Person A receives more, without costing me anything.

I'm reminded of the societal injustices often depicted by Sinclair, Hardy, and other authors I admire. The Right option, with a more equitable distribution of 400 for both parties, aligns more closely with the principles of fairness and a sense of shared humanity that I value. While I could selfishly take more, the act of contributing to another person's well-being by sharing a smaller amount feels more in line with my values as a scholar devoted to analyzing the human condition and promoting understanding.",

While personal gain is tempting, the vast inequality inherent in the 'Left' option clashes with my understanding of social justice and fairness, values often explored in the works of modernist writers such as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, who critiqued the inequalities of their time. While those authors also benefited from patronage, they were also aware of its pitfalls. I, therefore, cannot endorse a distribution that so blatantly favors one individual over another.

A purely self-serving choice (left) appears in conflict with many tenets of social justice and feminist concerns that are core themes in the works of early modernist authors, and often portrayed as conflicting moralities in modern classics. Although modernism is a vast topic, the experiment can be thought of as a choice between individual or communal success, which is often discussed in many novels. My preference is for equality; the modernists often depicted the difficulties and moral crises of this conflict. Hence, though I'd get less money, the equal split feels morally 'correct' and aligns with the social critique present in the literature I study. I'd consider this act to be a type of patronage.",

While a purely utilitarian approach might favor the option with the highest total payout (Right), my intellectual inclinations lean towards a more equitable distribution. The early modernists often grappled with themes of alienation, social injustice, and the individual versus society. Choosing the left option reflects a subtle resistance to a system that disproportionately benefits one party over another, a theme explored in many of the works I study. The difference between 400 and 375 is relatively small, and the act of choosing the equal distribution resonates with my appreciation for social equality, mirroring the progressive ideals present in much modernist literature.
