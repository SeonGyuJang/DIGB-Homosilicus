While individual success and resource accumulation were undoubtedly factors in ancient societies, the construction of massive structures like dolmens suggests a certain degree of collective effort and, perhaps, a prioritization of the group's needs. The choice between the two options represents a classic social preferences dilemma. Option Left gives me (Person B) more money than Person A (700 vs. 200), while option Right provides an equal split of 600 for each. My research focuses on understanding the social dynamics of past populations. Choosing option Right, although resulting in a slightly lower personal gain, aligns better with the cooperative spirit potentially involved in constructing these monuments. Furthermore, the difference between 700 and 600 is not significant enough to warrant prioritizing personal gain at the expense of equality. Fairness and a more equitable distribution resonates more strongly with my professional and intellectual understanding of ancient societies.",

A difference of 100 units in my favor (600 vs 500) is less significant than a gain of 400 units for person A (300 vs 700). This suggests a more equitable distribution of resources, which in a research context, could translate to improved opportunities for collaboration, data sharing, and ultimately, a better understanding of the megalithic monuments I study.

This aligns with a collaborative spirit often needed in fieldwork and research projects. Choosing the Right option gives Person A significantly more (750 vs. 375 for me), which while potentially beneficial for Person A, doesn't resonate with my values of fairness and shared success. The difference of 25 (400-375) for me is negligible. Therefore, the Left option provides a more desirable outcome based on my values and professional persona.",
