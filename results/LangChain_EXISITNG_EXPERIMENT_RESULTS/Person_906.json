As I have no information on Person A, or any particular reason to want them to have less, and my own payoff remains the same regardless of the choice, I will choose the option that gives them more.

Or is there a more equitable sharing, leading to a stronger, more resilient flock? In this experiment, my payoff doesn't change whether Person A gets something or nothing if I pick left. However, if I pick Right, the overall amount of resources in the system is the same, but Person A also gets something. From an evolutionary perspective, encouraging successful co-existence makes sense. I think it is very interesting to note that Person B is offered more of the resources, but Person A's gain with 'Right' is still very important to the viability of a finch population.",
