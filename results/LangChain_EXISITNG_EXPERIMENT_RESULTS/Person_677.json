I am receiving the same amount in either scenario. Therefore, I have no real preference. However, in the interest of maximizing the overall resources allocated (utilitarianism), I lean towards Right, as it results in a higher total distribution of units.\n\nGiven my background, I'm also cognizant that these types of systems are often designed to favor optimal overall resource allocation, rather than strict equality, to maximize throughput and system performance. My background would likely influence me toward that kind of solution and mindset. The slight increase to the overall pot leans me towards Right.",

The difference in my payout (800 vs 400) isn't significant enough to outweigh the inherent value I place on equitable distribution.

While I recognize the difference in allocation may not be 'fair' in a perfectly egalitarian sense, the sheer magnitude of increase for Person A, at a relatively small cost to myself, makes option Right a system-level efficiency win.
