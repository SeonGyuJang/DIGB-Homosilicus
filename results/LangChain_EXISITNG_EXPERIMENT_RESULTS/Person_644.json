The 'Right' option, while yielding nothing for either of us, represents a more equitable outcome, even if it means neither person benefits. This aligns with my teaching philosophy of fostering a sense of fairness and community in the classroom. Even though I understand the game is about individual choices, the vast inequality in the 'Left' option makes it unpalatable. Therefore, I choose the 'Right' option.",

The other option, 600 for both of us, is more equitable and promotes a sense of shared benefit. While I could use the extra 100, the principle of fairness overrides a small personal gain.

While getting 600 would be nice, I also want to be seen as someone who isn't solely motivated by personal gain. The choice on the right gives Person A more money than I receive. This aligns with the desire to be altruistic, but in practice it sacrifices money. However, the experiment might be assessing fairness or even how much people value being perceived as fair. I also don't know anything about Person A, so maximizing my own payoff seems justifiable. However, in a social setting, and considering the implicit 'lesson' being provided by this experiment, choosing the option that favors another person seems better overall in the spirit of cooperation and setting an example.\nSince the differences are not extreme, I would prefer to sacrifice 100 for myself to get 400 more to person A. I am not completely losing and Person A is better off in this case.",
