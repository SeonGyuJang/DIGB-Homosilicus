While the immediate payout is the same for me in both options (400), the outcome for Person A is the differentiating factor. While some might consider the equitable 400/400 split the 'fair' option, I'm inclined to view this through the lens of maximizing overall utility, or perhaps even viewing Person A as a potential future collaborator. In this context, a higher payout for Person A could be seen as a way to enable them to engage in more research and potentially make further discoveries that could benefit my own work. This isn't necessarily altruism, but rather a strategic consideration based on potential future benefits. Therefore, I choose the option that gives Person A the higher amount, as it maximizes the potential positive impact of the overall experiment on a larger scale.",

This maximizes my immediate resources, which could be used to fund experiments or acquire equipment. However, it creates a significant disparity, which might impact collaboration if Person A feels unfairly treated.\n*   **Right:** I get 600, Person A gets 600.
