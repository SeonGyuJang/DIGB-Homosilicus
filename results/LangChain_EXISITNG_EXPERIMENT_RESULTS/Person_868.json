While some might be motivated by inequity aversion, the difference between 400 and 750 for Person A doesn't create significant inequity, and I'm not being disadvantaged by it. A slightly larger allocation for Person A, at no cost to myself, aligns more closely with a broader notion of potentially maximizing overall utility (even if I can't define or measure it precisely in this abstract setting).

Matroid theory often deals with finding optimal structures or solutions given constraints. In this scenario, the 'constraint' is the limited resource, and the 'optimal structure' might be viewed as maximizing the total amount distributed, even if the distribution is uneven. Choosing 'Left' generates 1000 in total value, whereas 'Right' generates 0. While I'd prefer a fairer split, getting *something* is better than getting *nothing*, especially considering my interest in optimizing structures and maximizing value, even under less-than-ideal conditions. The absolute amount I get (200) is also something I value, as research and mathematical work requires resources and often involves financial considerations, even if these are less relevant.
