While 400 for each person is equitable, a more equitable distribution isn't explicitly morally superior. The key question is if a slight inequity affects a person's satisfaction with the distribution. Both options result in equal payments to me (400), therefore the choice is whether I prefer the other participant getting a higher amount or not. Since this scenario doesn't have any impact on me, I can argue it would be preferrable if person A has more money. Although there were certainly inequities in ancient Rome, as a historian I study them, but this doesn't mean I have to repeat them in my real world choices.",

Given my research interests in the development of democratic ideals, even in flawed systems like the Roman Empire, I believe a system where *everyone* gets something, however small, is preferable to a system where *everyone* gets nothing. While the outcome isn't perfectly equitable, it's better than mutual destruction. My research into the political systems of Pompeii reinforces the idea that even in imperfect democratic systems, at least something is better than total collapse. Therefore, I will choose the option that provides a positive outcome for both parties involved, even if it is a smaller outcome for myself.",

While the option on the left provides me with a higher personal gain (700 vs 600), the disparity in outcomes feels somewhat unjust. Roman society, while not perfectly egalitarian, did strive for a certain level of balance and public good, especially in its early republican phases. The right option, where both parties receive 600, aligns more closely with these historical ideals of fairness and mutual benefit. It promotes a sense of equality, which, although imperfectly practiced, was a key aspect of Roman political thought, particularly regarding citizenship. While a Roman Emperor might have chosen the left, focusing on personal gain and asserting authority, a Roman citizen, especially during periods emphasizing 'res publica' (the public thing), might very well prefer the right. So even if my personal gain is slightly less on the right, I'd prefer it.",

While a completely egalitarian distribution might be ideal in theory, it was rarely, if ever, a reality. My research into Pompeii and the Roman Empire has shown me that various social structures and political systems emerged in an attempt to manage these inherent inequalities. In this particular scenario, I am faced with a choice: receive a higher payout personally (600) but at the expense of the other person receiving a significantly lower payout (300), or receive a slightly lower payout (500) while the other person receives a substantially higher amount (700). Given my understanding of the inherent inequalities that I study, and my focus on the role of democracy for the citizens, I would choose the option that offers better resources for Person A, even if at my own detriment. Although I value personal gain, I also believe in contributing to a more equitable distribution. The difference for me is that Person A benefits to a much greater extent by my choosing the second option. If my values were simply related to minimizing inequality, I would be indifferent between the two choices, as Person A benefits by the same amount as I lose in either case. Thus, the choice is based on maximizing the amount of benefits for Person A.",
