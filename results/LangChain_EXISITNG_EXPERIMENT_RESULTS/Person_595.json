The right option, while resulting in me receiving less money (400), promotes an equal distribution between myself and my counterpart, resulting in overall well-being.

While receiving 200 units myself might seem initially appealing, the prospect of Person A receiving 800 suggests a larger pool of resources that could potentially be directed towards furthering scientific progress, even if indirectly. However, the core of this decision lies in how I interpret the context of this experiment. The Human Genome Project thrives on collaboration and shared resources, but this simple allocation scenario doesn't offer any guarantee that Person A's gain will benefit the overall project or society. Given the lack of information connecting this decision to the broader scientific goals, I'm ethically obligated to prioritize my own well-being. The experiment provides no indication that Person A would use the increased funds for something worthwhile. Therefore, I will choose the option where I receive something instead of nothing.",

The Human Genome Project, while offering incredible potential, also raises ethical concerns about fairness and access. Choosing the option where both of us receive 600 reflects a commitment to these principles of fairness, even in this abstract setting. It aligns with the collaborative spirit needed to address the complex ethical considerations surrounding scientific advancements. A fairer distribution can enable further collaboration and investment in this field. Therefore, I choose the option that provides both of us with equal, albeit slightly smaller, rewards.",
