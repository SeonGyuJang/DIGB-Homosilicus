The 'Right' option, while equitable in its outcome of zero for both, doesn't contribute to any positive outcome. In my line of work, even small gains in research funding or resources can lead to breakthroughs in developing antidotes. I will assume that person A might use the money to fund research or other things to better the world.

The 'Right' option provides a significantly larger amount to Person A (750) than the 'Left' option (400). Although Person B (myself) receives slightly less (375 vs 400), the substantial increase for Person A outweighs the minor personal loss. I am willing to prioritize the outcome that potentially benefits society more, even if I benefit slightly less personally. A larger amount to Person A, who might be conducting research to develop a treatment to deal with a dangerous toxin, aligns with my overall goals as a scientist. The benefits to Person A are much higher than my own.",
