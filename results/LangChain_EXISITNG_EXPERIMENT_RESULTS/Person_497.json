While I could take the higher personal gain, I lean towards a decision that appears more justifiable and less greedy.

Option Right gives me 375 and the other person 750. This brings the core questions of the experiment forward: Does the greater inequality of Right outweigh the lower but equal payoff in Left? If I'm solely motivated by maximizing my *own* payout, Left is the way to go.\n\nWhile the extra money would be nice, the difference between 375 and 400 is fairly small. The large disparity in Option Right, with the other person getting almost double what I get, feels unfair. Considering the spirit of social preferences and aiming for more equal (though slightly smaller overall) payoffs, I will choose the Left option.\n",
