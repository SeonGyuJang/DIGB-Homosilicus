Given my background, I am inclined to choose the option that leads to a more equitable outcome, and in this particular scenario, either outcome is fine because I end up with the same amount in each case. Since both options give me the same amount, I will pick the option that benefits the other person more, to try to prevent economic disparity, even on a small scale. In this experiment, the potential for large differences in outcomes for two people, may be suggestive of policies that promote or prevent future economic crises and thus choosing to benefit others will allow me to learn more about policy choices.",

A fairer distribution might lead to a more stable and resilient economic future, which is in line with my historical understanding. \n\nTherefore, while getting 800 is appealing, the potential benefit to both parties and the potential positive societal impact of a more equal distribution is significant.

While I receive 200, Person A receives a disproportionately large 800. Choosing 'Right' results in nothing for either of us.\n\nFrom the perspective of learning from history, I should consider how these choices reflect societal dynamics during depressions. A large wealth gap is often a characteristic. While this single choice won't cause a depression, choosing 'Left' arguably reinforces a structure that history shows can be problematic.\n\nTherefore, given that I am focused on mitigating effects of these periods, I will chose 'Right' as it eliminates the potential for an inequality to exist.",
