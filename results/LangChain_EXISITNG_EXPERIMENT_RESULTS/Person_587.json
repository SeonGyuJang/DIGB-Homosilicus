This resonates with the goal of making diagnostics accessible to all, regardless of their economic status. Therefore, a fairer distribution, even with a slight decrease in my individual payment, aligns with my professional values and the overarching goal of improving public health, especially in less privileged populations.

Given my dedication to low-cost diagnostics and resource allocation, I'm inclined to favor a choice that yields a greater overall impact, assuming Person A might utilize their larger sum for a useful purpose. The difference for me is minimal (25), but the increase for A is substantial (350).
