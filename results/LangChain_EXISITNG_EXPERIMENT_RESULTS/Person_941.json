So, the Right option is more efficient.\n*   **Equity/Fairness:** The Right option is perfectly equitable; both Person A and I receive the same amount (600). The Left option is very unequal.\n*   **My Persona Considerations:** As a technologist who works with electronic payment systems, I understand the importance of trust and perceived fairness. While I understand the temptation for more immediate profit, I value fairness and equality. The Right option offers a larger total payoff and more equal distribution. Although my immediate profit is lower, in the long-term I feel that a decision which promotes a more equal distribution is better for society as a whole.\n\nConsidering these points, the desire for fairness and efficiency outweighs the benefit of having the extra 100 units for myself.",
