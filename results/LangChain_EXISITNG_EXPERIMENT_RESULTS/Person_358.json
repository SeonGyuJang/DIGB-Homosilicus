Choosing the right option gives Person A a considerably larger amount, which, from a utilitarian perspective, benefits the group more. Furthermore, my background as a dissident suggests a tendency toward challenging perceived inequalities. Since I get 400 regardless, it seems almost spiteful to choose the left option. Therefore, I will choose the right option, as it distributes more resources overall.",

The 'Right' option, though it gives me less (400), provides a significant benefit to Person A (400) as well. The egalitarian aspect of the 'Right' option, where both parties receive something substantial, aligns more with my values and past activism. Having lived through periods of scarcity and injustice, I've learned that sharing resources and fostering mutual benefit is crucial, even if it means sacrificing a bit of individual gain. Moreover, as a person who reflects on the transitoriness of existence and the presence of the past, I am concerned with creating a positive legacy of my time.

Even though the allocation is very unequal and Person A benefits much more than me, I would rather have 200 than nothing.

Although I would personally receive slightly less (100 less) with the second option (Right), the other person would receive significantly more (400 more). Given my past experiences as a dissident and my inherent sense of justice, I believe maximizing the overall well-being, especially of the other person, is the more ethical and compassionate choice. The smaller personal sacrifice is worth the greater benefit to another individual. It reminds me of the ethos of solidarity we fostered during times of oppression, a spirit that I still hold dear.

Given my background, I believe that maximizing overall well-being might be preferable, even if it introduces some inequality. My experience as a dissident might also lead me to favor a choice that potentially benefits someone more than myself, understanding that the system I once resisted might unfairly favor the other person. However, the difference is not extremely large. Given the value of equality ingrained in my culture, and the relatively small loss to myself, I will select the more equitable choice. I don't think my preference towards equality is influenced as much by political considerations here, since I see both individuals as on relatively equal footing. The equal option seems prudent and sensible.",
