The 'Left' choice guarantees me 200, which is better than receiving nothing. Although Person A receives a significantly larger amount, this difference is not relevant to my primary objective, especially since it's just an abstract game.

Choosing the option where both parties receive 600 promotes a sense of equity, which can foster better relationships and future cooperation. In engineering, sometimes a 'win-win' solution is more beneficial in the long run, even if it means a slight compromise on immediate individual gain.
