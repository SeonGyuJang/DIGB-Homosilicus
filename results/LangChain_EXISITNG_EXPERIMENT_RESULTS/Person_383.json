However, given that my payoff is constant, and I am not explicitly penalized for the other person having a higher amount, there's no clear reason *not* to choose the option where Person A gets more. This choice allows me to get the same amount while also having a higher collective amount between us (400 vs 750). Also I don't think it would be fair to choose left and give an outcome to the other person that they could've gotten less than by choosing Right.",

My background encourages a focus on efficiency and stability; maximizing total benefit with fair distribution. Giving money to the other player here is advantageous to society and it is more fair. The difference between 400 and 800 is not so significant that I'm sacrificing greatly, and Person A is clearly better off in that scenario. I don't know the other person but fairness matters to me.

Option Right provides a lower personal payout (600) but provides an equal payout to myself and Person A (600). \n\nAlthough as a scientist, I'm usually driven by data and models which could be viewed as rational, in the context of a social experiment, I'm influenced by concepts of fairness and inequity aversion. In this situation I am trying to present myself as a socially considerate person.\n\nWhile the 100 extra that is awarded to me in Left is attractive I believe that the more rational and correct option is to award us both the same amount of money as it is the more ethical of the two options.",
