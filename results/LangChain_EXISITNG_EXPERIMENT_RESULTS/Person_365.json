Option (Right) provides a more equitable distribution, splitting the resources evenly (400 each). While a self-serving motive might initially lead to choosing (Left), my legal background encourages a consideration of fairness and potential future interactions. A more equitable outcome in (Right) could foster trust and reciprocity, which are valuable in legal and social contexts.
