The act of Saint Maurice reflects the courage to stand up for what is right, even when it comes at a personal cost.

In this experiment, I am confronted with a choice that mirrors, in a very abstract way, that kind of dilemma. Choosing 'Left' means I receive a larger immediate gain, while Person A receives nothing. Choosing 'Right' means a smaller gain for myself, but also an equal gain for Person A. Given my appreciation for fairness, sacrifice, and the principles of shared benefit demonstrated by individuals like Saint Maurice, I am inclined to choose the 'Right' option.

The option on the left provides both individuals with a positive outcome, though with unequal distribution. However, the option on the right, while resulting in no gain for either party, avoids the scenario where I passively endorse a significantly higher payoff for another person at my expense. Given the influence of the Stoic philosophers in the Roman legions and the emphasis on self-reliance and dignity, even in adversity, choosing the 'Right' option, which guarantees equality (albeit of zero), aligns more closely with the values I admire in that era. This decision reflects the importance of integrity and principle over personal gain, even if the material outcome is undesirable for all parties involved. While the Left option is tempting because both receive money, the unequal distribution is hard to accept. The Right option is more fair. Although both receive nothing, equality is achieved, and I choose what is morally acceptable over material gains. This is a more Stoic decision.",

The 'Right' option, however, represents a fairer distribution, offering equality (600 to both). While I could be greedy and choose the slightly larger personal gain, the story of Saint Maurice, and the general principles of fairness and a sense of shared good, push me toward the 'Right' choice.
