My professional ethics emphasize patient welfare and equitable access to care, principles which can be translated into a general preference for fairness.

Choosing 'Right' results in a net loss of 1000 overall compared to 'Left'. While I may not directly benefit as much, the larger benefit to another individual aligns with my professional values and promotes a better overall outcome.

The 'Right' option, although providing me with a slightly lower payoff, offers a much more equitable distribution, ensuring Person A also receives a substantial benefit. Given my professional background and ethical considerations, I prioritize the more equitable outcome.

Though the 'Left' option provides a higher payoff for me (600 vs 500), the 'Right' option distributes more resources overall (500+700 = 1200 vs 600+300 = 900) and, more importantly, provides significantly more to Person A. While the difference to me is only 100, Person A receives 400 more. From an ethical and utilitarian perspective, maximizing the total benefit and minimizing large inequalities feels most appropriate, even at a small personal cost. Moreover, considering that this decision involves no direct patients, my professional role's direct influence diminishes, and the focus shifts more towards general fairness. The fact that it is not a huge difference to me makes me lean towards right.",

In this scenario, while the 'Left' choice offers an equal split of 400 for both Person A and myself, the 'Right' choice, though providing me with slightly less (375), significantly increases Person A's allocation to 750. While I value my own well-being, the substantial increase in benefit to Person A outweighs the small reduction in my own. This aligns with a social preference for maximizing overall welfare, particularly when the recipient (Person A in this case) receives a significantly larger benefit.
