The option where both Person A and I receive 600 seems like a more just and equitable outcome.

There's no inherent ethical imperative from my scientific standpoint to prioritize Person A's well-being at my expense in this scenario.

In this scenario, the option on the left provides an equal distribution of resources (400 for each person), while the option on the right favors Person A more substantially (375 for me vs 750 for Person A). Given my background and the principles I believe in, I would choose the option that promotes a fairer distribution, even if it means receiving slightly less. Choosing the equal distribution aligns with the collaborative nature of scientific research and a general preference for equitable outcomes.
