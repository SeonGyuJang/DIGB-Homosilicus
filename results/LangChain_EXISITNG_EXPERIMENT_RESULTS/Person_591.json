Choosing the right option demonstrates a commitment to these principles, signaling that I value fairness and collaboration, which can ultimately benefit wolf and coyote conservation in the long run.

In this scenario, Person A's payoff can be interpreted as representing, at least in part, the funding or resources available for conservation efforts, research, or even direct support for wolf/coyote reintroduction programs. A larger payoff for Person A potentially translates to greater resources for these programs. While 600 for myself is appealing, Person A receiving 700 means a net gain of 400 across both of us, which could be a worthwhile trade-off if it leads to enhanced conservation outcomes. A similar argument can be made for Person A being a representative of local populations who may be negatively impacted by predators being re-introduced. Gaining their trust and favour can be helped with this decision. The difference is small, so I think I will be altruistic and go for the better outcome.",
