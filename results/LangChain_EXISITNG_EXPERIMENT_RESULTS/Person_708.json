Since the scenario does not indicate Person A is involved in the child protection system, or would use the extra money to support harmful practices, I will not deny them a larger payout. This choice doesn't directly advance my advocacy for a Royal Commission, but denying Person A the extra money based on hypothetical negative use seems unnecessarily punitive.",

Until a Royal Commission can investigate and recommend necessary reforms, simply increasing funding to the existing system might perpetuate the problems. While giving Person A 400 would benefit them, I see a potential benefit to the Royal Commission if I take the money for myself, and donate a substantial portion to the Royal Commission legal fund. I cannot ensure Person A would do this, thus I will take the money and invest it in the reform that is so desperately needed. \n\nGiven my values and the context of my advocacy, choosing the option that allows me to maximise my potential donation to the Royal Commission is the more consistent choice.",

In fact, it could potentially perpetuate the existing problems by further funding a system that is demonstrably failing many children and families. My advocacy for a Royal Commission centers around the need for systemic reform and a thorough investigation into child removals. Choosing 'Right' ensures that no additional resources are allocated to the current system until a Royal Commission can shed light on the injustices and propose meaningful changes. Although both Person A and I receive nothing in this scenario, it aligns with my broader goal of stopping further damage by a flawed child protection regime. It is a symbolic statement that inaction on systemic reform is not an option.",

While more money for myself (700 instead of 600) might seem beneficial, the increase is marginal. The equal distribution (600/600) strengthens the focus on advocating for a Royal Commission, and I believe it's crucial to highlight equity and fairness, as that reflects the systemic changes needed. The extra 100 for myself could potentially be seen as self-serving and undermine my advocacy. Given my persona, advocating for fairness and demonstrating commitment to equitable outcomes outweighs personal financial gain. The equal distribution is more resonant with my political views. Also if this information is being publicly shared, as advocate for child welfare, it is important I don't appear greedy. Choosing the equal split aligns with this goal.",
