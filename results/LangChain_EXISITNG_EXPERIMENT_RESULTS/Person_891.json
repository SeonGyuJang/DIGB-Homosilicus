While a completely equal distribution is appealing, the difference between 400 and 750 is significant. Choosing the 'Right' option benefits both individuals involved, despite the inequality.

Receiving 800 units directly benefits my academic/research pursuits more than receiving 400 while someone else also receives 400, especially when the allocation to the other person doesn't impact me or the research directly. A research trip to analyze the ashfall from the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle eruption could potentially utilize any funds I received, so maximising them would be very useful.

While the 'Left' option gives me slightly more (700), the difference isn't significant enough to risk appearing greedy and potentially damaging a research relationship with Person A. The long-term benefits of maintaining positive relationships outweigh the short-term gain of an extra 100.

While the money in this experiment is nice, it's a relatively small amount compared to the scale of the research I do. My primary concern isn't maximizing my personal gain in this situation. However, I'm also not particularly altruistic. Given the choice between getting 600 and the other person getting 300, versus getting 500 and the other person getting 700, the disparity in the latter option is more pronounced. Since the potential small inconvenience between 500 and 600 is so small, and I am not concerned with maximizing the other person's payout, I will choose the Left option where the difference in payouts is smaller. The impact of this experiment on my research is negligible, so a focus on relative fairness is reasonable. Also, I'm skeptical that Person A will use the extra money to directly benefit geological research - it is most likely it will be used for unrelated personal expenses.",
