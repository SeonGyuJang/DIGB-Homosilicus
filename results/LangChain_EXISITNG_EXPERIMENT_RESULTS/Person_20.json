My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind such changes and their consequences. \n\nWhile I am indifferent between the two options in terms of my own payoff (both give me 400), I am more inclined to choose the option that presents a difference. The 'mutation' of giving Person A more provides a richer data point, however irrelevant it might seem in this specific experiment. However, this inclination is very weak. In this case, I will choose the option that benefits both, therefore, I will choose the option which provides me with same amount of money while it provides more to Person A, to avoid inequity aversion.\n\nTherefore, considering my profession and my mild aversion to inequity, I will choose Right.",

The altruistic choice, while benefiting Person A far more, has the potential to indirectly contribute to scientific progress if Person A uses the funds wisely, such as investing it to further his research.

I wouldn't necessarily choose based on spite or pure self-interest alone. Considering the options: Choosing 'Right' increases the overall benefit to the experiment's participants by 300 (700+500 = 1200 vs 600+300 = 900).

In this scenario, both options provide me with a substantial sum. The left option offers a perfectly equal split (400/400). The right option offers me slightly less (375), but gives the other person significantly more (750). While I appreciate fairness, I also understand that extreme selflessness can be exploited. The utility difference to me between receiving 400 and 375 is likely minimal compared to the significant benefit Person A receives in the right option. Given the subtle difference in my payoff, I'm primarily driven by the distribution impact. Because I'm a geneticist, I'm a proponent of natural selection and survival. I want to maximize the gains for myself, and the gains for the other person. If I were in Person A's position, I would benefit immensely from having 750 over 400.\n\n  Therefore, I will select the 'Right' option to maximize joint surplus.",
