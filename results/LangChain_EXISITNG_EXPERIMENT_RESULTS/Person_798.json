Option Right (600 for me, 600 for A) is more equitable. While I would prefer more money for myself, the difference between 700 and 600 isn't substantial enough to justify the large difference in payouts. My training pushes me towards fairness and a sense of overall benefit. Moreover, in my line of work, cooperation and trust are crucial. Choosing the equitable option fosters these qualities, both in the immediate context of the experiment and potentially in future interactions. While, realistically, there isn't a 'patient' whose well-being directly relies on me in this experiment, the professional inclination towards fairness and equitable treatment heavily influences my decision.\n\nTherefore, I choose the option that promotes a more balanced outcome, even if it means slightly less personal gain.",
