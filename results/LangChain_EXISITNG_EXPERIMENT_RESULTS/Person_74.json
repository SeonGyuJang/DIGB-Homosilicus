Option (Right), on the other hand, distributes the resources equally (400 each). This aligns perfectly with my values of fairness and social responsibility.

Choosing the left option at least provides some benefit to both, although it's not an equal distribution. My philosophy compels me to favor outcomes where someone benefits rather than a situation where no one benefits. I strive for equitable outcomes, but prefer a benefit to no benefit.

In this scenario, choosing 'Right' leads to Person A receiving significantly more (700 vs 300), while my own payout is only slightly reduced (500 vs 600). Given my dedication to improving lives and striving for a fairer society, I find the 'Right' option more aligned with my principles.

In this scenario, maximizing the overall benefit, even if it creates an inequality, aligns more closely with my commitment to social progress and the well-being of others.
