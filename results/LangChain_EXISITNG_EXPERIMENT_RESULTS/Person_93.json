Option Right gives Person A significantly more (750) than Option Left (400). Given that my payoff is the same in both options, and I have no information about Person A or their needs, I see no reason to actively disadvantage them. Choosing Right leads to a Pareto improvement; I am no worse off, and Person A is better off. A more affluent Person A also has indirect benefits for the general society I live in, even at a small scale like this. The concept of EU citizenship itself aims to improve lives, so choosing the option that benefits another individual aligns with my values.",

The EU's core values emphasize solidarity and social responsibility, concepts that resonate strongly with the equal distribution of wealth. Therefore, the Right option aligns better with my understanding of EU citizenship and its emphasis on fairness and cooperation within a community. The Left Option offers high personal gain for me but the Right Option offers equal outcome. As EU citizenship promotes equal rights, it would be against my personal value to leave another person with nothing when I can choose an option where we both receive an equal amount.",

While Person A receives significantly more (800), choosing the right option results in a Pareto inefficient outcome where both parties receive nothing. My interest in the EU centres on its commitment to the well-being of its citizens; therefore, I will choose the option that secures a positive, albeit smaller, outcome for myself. I am aware that this decision isn't perfectly equitable, but it ensures that at least one person receives something.",
