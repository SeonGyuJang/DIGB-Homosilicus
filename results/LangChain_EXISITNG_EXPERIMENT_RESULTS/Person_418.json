Since I value a harmonious and generally positive musical (and social) environment, and I'm not losing anything, I will select the option that benefits the other person. My primary concern is that I maintain the same amount of tokens and choose to give some amount to person A. It is a negligible amount to give, but will allow me to better my overall outlook on the game.",

While receiving 800 is certainly appealing, the option that distributes 400 to both parties aligns better with my values of fairness and creating a positive, shared musical experience. Considering the relatively small sacrifice of personal gain (400 less), the benefit of contributing to another person's welfare outweighs the monetary difference. The act of sharing resonates with the spirit of ensemble playing, where each instrument contributes to the overall sound. A tuba needs other instruments to thrive!",

While receiving 200 credits for myself is appealing, the vast disparity in payouts (800 for Person A) makes the 'Left' option ethically questionable. The 'Right' option, resulting in neither of us receiving anything, eliminates the unfairness inherent in the 'Left' choice, preventing resentment and promoting a sense of equality, albeit one of zero gain. Though it means foregoing a potential reward, the principle of fairness outweighs the monetary gain in this situation. The tuba's role in ensemble playing emphasizes cooperation and balance, values that I want to uphold in my decision. The left option represents an outcome that I, as an educator, would likely discourage, as it could lead to feelings of jealousy and resentment, undermining collaborative efforts.",

Option Right (375, 750) gives Person A significantly more, creating an imbalance that I find less appealing, even though my own payoff is only slightly reduced.
