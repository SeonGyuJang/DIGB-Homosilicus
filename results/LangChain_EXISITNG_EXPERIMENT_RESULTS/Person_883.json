Although an equal distribution appeals to my sense of fairness, the large difference in payoff for Person A makes the right choice more compelling. A wealthier Person A could potentially invest in or support initiatives aligned with my values (sustainable building, renewable energy, etc.).

The alternative, where both Person A and I receive 400, aligns far better with my commitment to equitable outcomes and a sense of shared prosperity.
