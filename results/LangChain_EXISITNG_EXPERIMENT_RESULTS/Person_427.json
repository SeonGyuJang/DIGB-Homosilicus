'Right' offers a fairer distribution (600 vs 600), even though I receive slightly less. While maximizing my own gain is tempting, the significant difference in earnings in the 'Left' option makes me uneasy. I feel a more equitable distribution in 'Right' is preferable, even if it means a small personal sacrifice.

The difference isn't substantial enough for me to prioritize the slight increase in personal gain over the potential, albeit minor, security risk. The difference between the two outcomes is only a small increase for me (100). In the right hand choice, Person A gets more than me.
