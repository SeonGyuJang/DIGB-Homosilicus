A slightly lower personal payoff coupled with a substantially larger payoff for the other person *could* be justifiable under certain circumstances. However, in the absence of any additional information about Person A or the context of the distribution, I will prioritize the equal split. It's a straightforward, defensible choice that avoids any potential for perceived unfairness or inequity. It's also simple and efficient, much like well-written code.\n\nThe 'Left' option also aligns with a sort of 'defensive programming' principle.
