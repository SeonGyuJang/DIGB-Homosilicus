While both options benefit me equally (400), the right option benefits Person A more (750 vs. 400). I'm inherently skeptical of pure self-interest in these scenarios, and, given my background, I'm inclined to view the situation as a learning opportunity about fairness, resource allocation, and possibly even the motivations of 'Person A' (though I have no information about them). While a perfectly equal distribution is appealing, the moderate asymmetry of option 'Right' does not trigger a strong negative reaction. I don't feel any significant negative utility from the other player receiving a greater reward. Therefore, given that my payoff is unchanged, I'm choosing the option that maximizes Person A's outcome. This might be due to my tendency to interpret situations as pedagogical exercises or perhaps a general inclination towards actions that benefit others.",

The second option (600 for both) promotes equality which is more aligned with my values. I understand that in real life, resource distribution is rarely perfectly equal, and that factors beyond one's control can contribute to inequities.

My focus is more on the craft and value of writing. The difference between 400 and 375 is not substantial enough to override a preference for a more equitable outcome.
