The fact that Person A receives significantly more money suggests that the process that led to this split may not be ethical or fair. I feel that choosing to give up my 200 and A's 800 in the hope that no one receives any money is better than allowing such a system.\n\n  Therefore, I feel the ethical choice in this scenario is to forgo any personal gain to prevent the system that made it possible.

In the context of medical devices, lack of transparency and unequal distribution of benefits often lead to patient exploitation and compromised safety.\n\n  While there is an immediate temptation to maximize my own payoff in Option (Left), my professional ethics as a medical journalist compels me to consider the broader implications of my choices. Choosing Option (Right) aligns with my desire for a fairer and more equitable outcome. It implicitly signals a preference for cooperation and shared benefit, values which I believe are crucial in the medical field.

My role as a journalist is to hold power accountable and advocate for those potentially harmed by faulty devices. Choosing Right, where Person A benefits more, implicitly acknowledges a certain level of social responsibility, a value I hold dear.
