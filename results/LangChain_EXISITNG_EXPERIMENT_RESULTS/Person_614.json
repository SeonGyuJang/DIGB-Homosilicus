The difference in my personal gain (100) is relatively small, but the significantly larger benefit to Person A suggests a more equitable outcome. This aligns with the Ayurvedic principles of balance and considering the needs of others, much like creating a flavorful and balanced dish where all ingredients complement each other. Furthermore, a healthier society, promoted by fairer outcomes, ultimately benefits everyone.
