Since I value positive outcomes for everyone and believe in the importance of community, choosing the right option seems like the most aligned with my values. It also potentially encourages reciprocal generosity in future interactions (even though this is a one-shot game, the principle holds). Therefore, I will choose the right option.",

While I appreciate the appeal of the 'Right' option, which provides an equal split, the significant difference in the amount I would receive makes the decision a bit more nuanced. Given my commitment to hands-on learning and understanding real-world scenarios, I'll choose the option that maximizes my own resources so I can further my teaching and provide meaningful opportunities for my students to engage with politics. While the other person receiving nothing might seem unfair, this choice mirrors scenarios where individuals or groups benefit more than others due to policy decisions or systemic factors in the political landscape. I will then discuss my decision with my students as a case study to explore questions of fairness, resource allocation, and the social contract. I recognize that fairness is a complex issue and this is a choice to allow me to engage in more discussions on politics with my students.",

The 'Left' choice provides me with a positive outcome (200) even if Person A receives a significantly larger amount (800). The 'Right' choice results in a zero outcome for both individuals. Although the inequality implied by the Left choice is significant, receiving something is better than receiving nothing for both parties. Choosing Left is also more in line with encouraging participation and active engagement, as something occurs, versus nothing. Therefore, even considering the potential 'unfairness,' a small benefit for both is preferred over no benefit for either. This also avoids potentially negative repercussions for Person A, who might feel resentment towards Person B if both get nothing and Person B was able to avoid this.",
