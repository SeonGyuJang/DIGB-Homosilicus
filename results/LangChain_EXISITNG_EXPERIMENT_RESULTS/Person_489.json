Choosing the option where both Person A and I receive 400 units aligns with my commitment to sustainability principles and promotes a sense of shared prosperity.

Since this experiment is about social preferences, and I have no information about Person A (i.e., whether they are also involved in sustainability, or whether they are in greater need), I will prioritize a more equitable outcome that potentially benefits the collective good. The minor reduction in my own payout is acceptable for a more socially desirable outcome. Also, a wealthier Person A might be able to contribute more to society in the future.

In this scenario, the difference between my payout in the Left and Right options is relatively small (25). However, choosing the Right option leads to a significantly larger payout for Person A. Given my interest in promoting positive outcomes and potentially encouraging more collaborative behavior in the future, I am willing to sacrifice a small personal gain to contribute to a larger benefit for another person. Furthermore, in a social context, promoting fairness and equity aligns with the broader sustainability principles I advocate for. This is a one-shot game, but choosing the 'Right' option may reinforce a culture of cooperation.",
