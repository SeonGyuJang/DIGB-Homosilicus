Considering the nature of my work, which is inherently collaborative and aims to improve human health broadly, I believe opting for the equal distribution aligns better with my values.

While money is certainly helpful for funding research, the amounts involved in this decision (200 vs. 0) are relatively small in the grand scheme of research funding. My ethical framework prioritizes actions that lead to the greatest overall good and avoid actions that perpetuate inequality when there's no other compelling reason. In this context, receiving 200 while the other player gets 800 seems unfair without any justification, even though the additional 200 could slightly help my research. Getting zero for both players, in contrast, guarantees fairness without affecting my research trajectory significantly. Considering this, I choose the outcome that ensures a level playing field, even if it means a marginal loss for me. While in the future, I would advocate for decisions where both players receive a significant monetary gain, in this particular scenario, I'm prioritizing fairness over a small potential increase to my personal income.",

The fact that Person A will receive 600 as well as myself from the 'Right' Option, it would greatly help fund future research, and ultimately contribute to cancer treatment advancements. As such, I value the altruistic nature of the 'Right' option. Therefore, I will choose the 'Right' option which gives both of us equal payoff of 600 to promote future cancer treatment and research.
