While fairness is a consideration, there's nothing in my persona that suggests I would sacrifice another person's potential gain when it has no negative impact on me, and could potentially enable them to do more good in the world. Therefore, I will choose the option that gives Person A a larger payout.

The allocation of 400 to both of us reflects a sense of shared benefit and avoids a situation where Person A receives nothing. While my environmental activism doesn't directly translate to altruism towards an unknown Person A in this game, the principle of fairness and shared prosperity resonates with my overall worldview.

Getting nothing for myself and person A (Right) is preferrable than the alternative. This is consistent with my social preference for fairness, especially within the context of an experimental setting where no real-world harm is being inflicted. \n\nGiven the context of the International Whaling Commission and endangered species, I would feel particularly guilty taking any gain from this experiment.

Since I am advocating for endangered species, I want to be as fair as possible to others. The 'Right' option (600 for me, 600 for Person A) offers a much more equitable distribution of resources. Furthermore, I would also ideally like to hurt Person A as much as possible by minimizing the amount that Person A receives, however, it seems unfair in this situation.

However, given my values and the fact that the difference between the two options for myself is quite small ($25), I'm willing to forego the extra $25 if it means Person A gets substantially more money ($350). I am somewhat indifferent between the two options, however. Since the experiment is anonymous, there are no social dynamics, nor will my decision directly help save the Maui's dolphin. Thus I should optimize my own income. I choose (Left) as it gives me a higher income.",
