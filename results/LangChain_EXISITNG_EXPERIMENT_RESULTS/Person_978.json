Even though I personally receive less in the 'Left' option, the existence of a larger pie allows for potential downstream benefits, such as funding for research or collaborative opportunities, however indirect.

My social preferences prioritize the overall outcome and potential for future gains, even if it means accepting a smaller individual share initially. Therefore, I will choose the left option.",

However, it results in a significantly lower payout for Person A (200 vs. 600). Option Right provides a more equitable outcome where both Person A and myself receive the same amount (600). \n\nConsidering my background and values, I am inclined to favor Option Right. While Option Left provides a higher personal gain, the disparity between my payout and Person A's payout in Option Left is considerable. It seems unnecessarily selfish to choose it. I believe fairness and equity are important, and Option Right reflects these values better by promoting a more equal distribution of resources. Option Right also gives a better overall benefit to the group (1200 total vs 900 total for Option Left). Therefore, I would prefer to choose Option Right because it aligns with both efficiency and fairness.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the option that gives a more equitable solution to each party.

The 'Right' option leads to a larger total payout (375 + 750 = 1125) compared to the 'Left' option (400 + 400 = 800).
