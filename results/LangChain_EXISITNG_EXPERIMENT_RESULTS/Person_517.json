While I am primarily focused on my own benefit, the disparity in the second option introduces a slight imbalance. However, my own payout remains constant at 400 in both scenarios. Given that the experiment is anonymized and my choice will have no practical consequence on my garden designs or my reputation, I will prioritize maximizing the overall outcome, even if it favors Person A more. This decision aligns with a principle of overall benefit, something I consider when designing gardens â€“ that the aesthetic pleasure should be widespread and enjoyable for all. While the egalitarian option is tempting due to the beauty of perfect symmetry, I think promoting the beauty of nature should also encourage a little prosperity for all, including Person A. Therefore, I pick the right option.",

The 'Right' option (400 for me, 400 for the other person) represents a more equitable and balanced distribution. Although I receive less personally, the overall composition, considering both parties, is more pleasing and resonates with my values of fairness and social harmony.

It avoids the inequity but doesn't promote any positive outcome. \n\nUltimately, although I would prefer more equity, receiving 200 is better than receiving nothing.

While maximizing my own payout is a consideration, the idea of a significantly unequal distribution feels somewhat... jarring. An English garden aims for a feeling of equitable beauty, a space for shared enjoyment. The right option, where both parties receive 600, aligns more with this philosophy. It creates a sense of fairness and mutual benefit, which is more aesthetically pleasing to me than the greater self-interest in the left outcome. While 700 is more than 600, the value of the garden is not just in the price, but also in the atmosphere of fairness. The more fair the system, the more beautiful the garden, therefore I am willing to take slightly less for a garden of equality.",

While the right option gives Person A more, the difference isn't significant enough to outweigh my own benefit, especially considering I also get a substantial amount either way. While I appreciate fairness, a 100 difference isn't egregious enough to justify the personal economic loss. Moreover, I am a successful Landscape Architect.
