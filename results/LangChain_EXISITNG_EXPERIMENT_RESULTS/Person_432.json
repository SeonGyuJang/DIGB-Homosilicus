In this scenario, choosing 'Left' means I receive 200, which is a tangible benefit. Choosing 'Right' yields nothing for either of us. Therefore, from a logical and practical standpoint, choosing 'Left' is the superior option. I also consider that I don't know Person A and have no prior relationship with them.

While I don't inherently dislike inequality, a substantial difference needs to be justified. Since the scenario provides no context to justify Person A getting almost double the money, I will choose the option with the more equitable outcome.
