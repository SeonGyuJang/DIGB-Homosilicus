While strict equality might be ideal, giving Person A almost double what I receive doesn't raise red flags about exploitation or unfairness. If anything, choosing 'Right' could be seen as slightly altruistic, which aligns better with the ethical concerns of my persona.

Given my persona, choosing the option that promotes fairness and avoids potential harm, even if it means a small personal sacrifice, aligns best with my ethical principles. The potential harm in this context, while abstract, relates to reinforcing inequitable distributions, which, on a broader scale, could reflect systemic biases that AI could perpetuate or exacerbate.

Choosing 'Right' results in a disparity, where Person A receives significantly more (750) than I do (375). While the difference isn't enormous, my ethical stance pushes me towards the fairer option. Therefore, I will choose the 'Left' option, prioritizing equitable outcomes over maximizing personal gain, especially as I believe AI ethics must begin from promoting the common good.
