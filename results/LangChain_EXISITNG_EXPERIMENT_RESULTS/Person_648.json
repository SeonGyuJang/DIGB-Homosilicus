The right option gives Person A a significantly higher payout, although it reduces my personal payout slightly. \n\nWhile maximizing my personal gain would be one approach, my profession instills a sense of fairness and a desire to alleviate suffering. In this context, the difference between 600 and 500 is not significant enough to outweigh the substantial benefit Person A would receive from choosing the right option. A similar payout discrepancy in my professional life would encourage me to choose a treatment that prioritizes the person with a bigger need.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the right option, accepting a slightly lower personal gain in order to provide a much larger benefit to Person A.

The right option, while giving me slightly less (375), provides Person A with significantly more (750). \n\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, the left option is preferable. However, considering a broader perspective that incorporates a degree of altruism, and acknowledging that I am still receiving a substantial amount in either scenario, I lean towards the right option.

The difference for person A is 350 (750-400), while the difference for me is only 25 (400-375).\n\nGiven the context of this experiment and my profession, I would likely choose the right option as it represents a slightly more efficient allocation and demonstrates some concern for the well-being of Person A without significantly sacrificing my own gain.",
