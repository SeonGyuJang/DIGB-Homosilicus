From a purely rational, outcome-oriented perspective, I'm indifferent. However, I would ever-so-slightly favor the Right option. The fact that Person A would get a larger sum of money for essentially no reason to either participant is a slight positive to society. Even if they receive an income equal to that of a dentist (an average salary for professionals that practice medicine in Malaysia), this small injection of money would be viewed favorably. The amount would not influence or affect the lives of either party. Therefore, my choice would be to go with the 'Right' option, given the option would slightly benefit another party.",
