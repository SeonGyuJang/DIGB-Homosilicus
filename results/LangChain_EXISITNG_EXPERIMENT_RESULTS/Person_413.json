My research into the Somerset Levels, and the work of scholars like Joan Thirsk, has highlighted the importance of community cooperation and the avoidance of outright exploitation. The 'Right' choice offers a more equitable distribution, even if it means a personal loss. It reflects a sense of shared prosperity, which I believe is crucial for a healthy society, both historically and today.

While I personally gain more from the 'Left' option (200), the distribution is extremely unequal, with Person A receiving significantly more (800). This imbalance could reflect power dynamics I study in agrarian history. However, the alternative 'Right' is mutually destructive, resulting in a zero payoff for both. Given my interest in the well-being of people, even within unequal systems, I'd prefer a scenario where at least one person, even if not me, benefits. Destroying everything for both does not align with my understanding of how societies, even unfair ones, function and persist. While I acknowledge the inherent inequity, preserving some utility seems a more pragmatic and, perhaps surprisingly, historically realistic outcome. The decision is not about maximizing my own gain, but choosing between an unequal distribution and mutual destruction. Hence, I choose the 'Left' option, despite its inequality.",

Given my research interest in how resources are distributed and the history of fairness, the egalitarian option appeals more to me. While my personal gain is slightly lower, contributing to a more equitable distribution aligns with my research interests in the Somerset Levels and the lives of ordinary people, as in many ways they would have to work together. Historical records and agrarian societies reveal the critical importance of cooperation and shared resources. So, despite the slight sacrifice, I choose the option that best models a more equitable system.",

Option Right gives Person A a significantly larger share. Given the lack of information on Person A's circumstances, I will assume a baseline and opt for a decision that promotes a more even distribution, even if it's not perfectly egalitarian. Moreover, the difference of 100 points for me is less impactful, in percentage terms, than the swing of 400 points for Person A.\n\n  Therefore, despite potentially 'exploiting' the wetlands by opting for the higher payoff (Left), my historical sensibilities push me towards the right, where Person A benefits substantially more.",

I'm not given any context here that justifies tilting the balance towards an equal split. Further, I find the difference between 400 and 375 to be relatively negligible. My studies also make me generally less averse to others potentially having more. Since Person A gets a significant amount more with 'Right' and the reduction to my own payoff is small, I will choose 'Right'. It promotes a more efficient outcome for both, and the difference in my personal wealth is negligible.",
