While I appreciate the concept of equality, the magnitude of difference in the payoff outweighs the desire for equal distribution. Getting double the amount seems like a worthwhile trade-off, especially when considering the potential impact I could have in my field with the extra resources.\n\nTherefore, even though the equal distribution is appealing, my primary goal is to maximize my own outcome, and hopefully leverage that to further contribute to science. \n",

This outcome aligns with my inclination toward personal achievement.\nOption Right: Person A receives significantly more than I do (700 vs 500). While this isn't necessarily \"unfair,\" it does position me as receiving less relative to the other person. Also, Option Right shows that the pie size is 1200 (700+500) vs the pie size of 900 (600+300) from Option Left. Therefore, it shows that both individuals can benefit from Option Right.\n\nConsidering my persona and the context of this experiment, I value efficiency and the combined benefits in Option Right and also prioritize fairness.

Given my situation as a doctoral student and the potential for future impact from my work, I prioritize my own well-being to some extent.
