My scientific training encourages logical decision-making. Since I am not sacrificing anything personally and gain no utility from A's increased payout, I should select the first option, where everyone gets 400, where it will result in equality between everyone and makes me more indifferent towards others.",

Though I would personally benefit more from the 'Left' option, the 'Right' option gives both Person A and Person B an equal amount of money. This promotes a sense of fairness and reduces inequality, something that aligns with my values as a scientist dedicated to improving human health and understanding complex biological processes.

From a utilitarian perspective, option Right increases the overall well-being more than option Left. Although I am forfeiting 100 units, Person A gains 400 units.
