Focusing solely on Altunköprü's issues in this artificial scenario feels somewhat tone-deaf. Furthermore, choosing 'Right' doesn't negatively impact me; I still receive 400.

This disparity might exacerbate existing tensions or inequalities within the community, something I would want to report on and potentially ameliorate. However, getting 200 would allow me to allocate it towards documenting the oral histories of Turkmens, the indigenous population, which the recent Kurdish and Arab populations may not have access to or understanding of, giving an incentive to choose 'left'. \n\nWithout further information about Person A (their background, potential connection to Altunköprü, or their needs), I am incentivized to take the 'left' option as 200 is better than 0 for me, and 800 > 0 for Person A.\n\nGiven my persona, I'm not purely motivated by personal gain but also concerned about the implications of my choice.

While I appreciate a higher payoff for myself, the more equitable distribution of 600 for both Person A and myself aligns better with promoting a sense of fairness and shared prosperity, which is vital for inter-ethnic relations in a town like Altunköprü. Choosing 'Right' reflects a desire to avoid creating imbalances that could potentially exacerbate existing tensions or perceived injustices. It is important to note that since I am just a journalist and historian, money is important to me as well. I am not willing to pass up a lot of money to be fair.
