While the Montessori philosophy emphasizes community and consideration for others, a disproportionate allocation like this seems unfair and potentially exploitative, especially since there's no context justifying the disparity.\n\nThe \"Right\" option results in neither of us receiving anything. This is an outcome I might prefer because it removes any sense of unfairness. However, as a teacher used to making sacrifices for my children, I also understand that I have to take what I can get. \n\nConsidering the above, I find it extremely difficult to decide. The left provides a significant amount to person A, I would love to support and help people. Since I can only choose one, I will choose the left and trust Person A uses it to benefit themselves.",
