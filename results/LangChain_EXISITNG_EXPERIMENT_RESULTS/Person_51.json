Opting for 'Right' results in a complete loss for both parties, which is detrimental from a utilitarian perspective and doesn't advance any scientific goals.

From a societal and experimental perspective, choosing the equitable outcome provides more data for understanding social preferences and avoids skewing results toward pure self-interest. While a slight personal benefit is tempting, the overall benefit to the experiment and potentially the community through a better understanding of social behavior outweighs the immediate personal gain. It also reduces the chance of inducing envy or resentment in Person A, potentially influencing future behavior in follow-up experiments.

Option Right provides Person A with a larger payoff (700 vs 300 in Option Left), indicating a higher total payoff for the pair. Since the difference in my own payoff is relatively minor (600 vs 500), I prefer the option that maximizes the overall payoff for both of us.

The extra resources available to Person A could potentially be used for more research and development.
