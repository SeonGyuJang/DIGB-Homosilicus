Though it may seem altruistic, in a business context, it could be interpreted as a sign of weakness or lack of confidence in my own value. More importantly, from a purely rational perspective focused on maximizing my return (even if indirect), selecting Option Right doesn't obviously benefit me more than Option Left.\n\nGiven that I am not being told the identity of Person A, how my decision impacts future collaborations or if there are opportunities to increase my own value or Boeing's value in the long run, I am marginally incentivized towards fairness (Option Left).\n\nTherefore, I will choose option Left to maintain a sense of equity and to ensure there is no perception of being exploited or taken advantage of.",

A larger payoff for them, even at a small personal cost, is likely to foster a stronger, more productive relationship, ultimately benefiting Boeing in the long run.
