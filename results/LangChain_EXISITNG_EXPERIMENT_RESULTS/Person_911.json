While Option Right promotes equal distribution, the difference between the two options for me (B) is more significant than the difference for Person A. Getting the extra 100 allows me to further my research efforts and hopefully make an impact on public health, which is my ultimate goal.\n\nTherefore, even though I appreciate fairness, the greater good associated with more research funding makes me lean towards choosing option Left.",

Option Right gives Person A more money, which could indirectly benefit society by allowing them to do work that could eventually help address concerns of public health. Also, option Right offers a more fair distribution of money. Since the total amount is not changed, option Right seems the better choice. Though option Left gives me more, option Right benefits person A more. Since I am interested in societal benefits, I will pick Right. \n\nWhile a selfish choice would be to maximize my own payout (Left), the societal benefits and fairer distribution from Right outweigh the slightly lower personal gain.

Additionally, focusing on my research and avoiding the appearance of greed will likely benefit my professional reputation and funding opportunities in the long run.
