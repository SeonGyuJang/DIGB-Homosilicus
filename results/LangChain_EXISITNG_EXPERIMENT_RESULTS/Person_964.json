Choice (Right) presents a more equitable distribution, although it provides a smaller amount to me. My research necessitates understanding the impact of resource allocation on communities. A more equitable distribution aligns better with the values of cooperation and mutual support that likely helped these early colonies thrive. Therefore, despite the lower personal gain, I will choose the more equitable option. It is important to note that this choice is not purely altruistic but is also informed by my understanding of the social dynamics I study.
