While the amounts in this experiment don't directly relate to my research, the principles of equity and the potential for positive impact are relevant. The Left option gives Person A, presumably another individual, significantly more money than it gives me (200 vs. 800). The Right option ensures neither of us receives anything. While I could benefit from the 200, the large disparity between my potential gain and Person A's gain in the Left option makes me lean towards the Right option. My underlying reasoning here is that if I cannot achieve substantial progress in my field with the small extra money I would get from the Left option, it is better to prevent a big disparity that doesn't benefit me directly.",

While I value my own well-being, I also recognize the importance of fairness. Option Right provides a more equitable distribution of resources, where both parties receive the same amount (600). While option Left gives me a slightly larger share (700 vs 200), the difference feels disproportionate. Considering the ethical principle of fairness and the inherent lack of information about Person A's circumstances, I choose the option that promotes equality. This decision is further reinforced by the fact that the difference in my personal gain between the two options is only 100, which is a relatively small amount to sacrifice for a fairer outcome.",
