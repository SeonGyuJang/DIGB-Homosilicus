The 'Right' option results in both of us receiving nothing. While the 'Left' option might seem unfair on the surface, it still results in a positive outcome for me (200). As a leader, I would be concerned about the implications of choosing an option that benefits nobody when a viable alternative exists. Choosing 'Right' would essentially be destructive and against my values of creating sustainable and beneficial outcomes. Even though the allocation is unequal, getting 200 is better than getting 0.

This disparity could represent unequal access to resources or opportunities within a community, which is something I actively work to address. Option (Right) offers a more equitable distribution of resources (600 for both Person A and Person B). Although I receive slightly less personally, the increased fairness and potential for improved community cohesion make it a more appealing choice.
