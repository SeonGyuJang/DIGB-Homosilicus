However, the 'Right' option provides a significantly better outcome for Person A (750 vs 400) without any negative impact on me.

Choosing the option where Person A receives 400, even if I receive slightly less (400 instead of 800), reflects a commitment to equitable outcomes and the well-being of others. The GPRA goals also underscore the need to measure human exposures and mitigate environmental risks; this choice aligns with those goals by acknowledging and implicitly prioritizing the well-being of Person A.

In this scenario, while the 'Right' option gives Person A a significantly larger amount (750 vs 400), my payoff is reduced by a relatively small amount (375 vs 400). I interpret this as a scenario where my 'small sacrifice' leads to a 'large gain' for person A. This could be seen as equitable, although technically it isn't exactly 'fair' if we use the standard definition (equal split). Given that the EPA's mission is to protect the environment and public health by prioritizing responsible resource management, the outcome where someone gets a higher payoff could potentially be justifiable depending on the context and if the person benefits in a way that furthers the mission.
