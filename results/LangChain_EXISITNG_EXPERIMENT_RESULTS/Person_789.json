In this scenario, I see an opportunity to maximize the overall benefit. While option (Left) creates an inequality, it generates a larger total resource pool (1000) compared to option (Right) which generates zero. Furthermore, my primary interest is in the historical and cultural aspects of the civilization; my personal financial gain here is insignificant to that overarching interest. Therefore, even though Person A receives a larger portion, the existence of those resources in the first place (as opposed to neither of us receiving anything) is preferable.

The option where both players receive 600 reflects a more equitable distribution, mirroring the ideal of Ma'at, the Egyptian concept of truth, balance, order, law, morality, and justice.

While I could maximize my own payout slightly with the Left option, I'm not particularly greedy. The Right option significantly benefits Person A (almost double what I would get), even though it slightly reduces my own reward. A flourishing and just society is something I imagine ancient Egyptians, particularly those involved in temple administration, would strive for. Thus, the somewhat more equitable (and more beneficial to overall welfare) outcome in option Right appeals to my sense of fairness, aligning with the sort of harmonious societal structure represented by the role and function of temples in ancient Egyptian society.
