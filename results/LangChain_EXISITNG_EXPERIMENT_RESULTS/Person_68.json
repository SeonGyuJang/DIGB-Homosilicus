Option Left gives me 600 and Person A 300, while Option Right gives me 500 and Person A 700.\n\n  While a purely selfish decision might favor Option Left (getting 600), I will consider the broader picture. The difference of 400 between A and B in Left, and 200 between A and B in Right, is a fairness concern. Though, I don't have any information about who Person A is and how the amounts will be used.\n\n  Since I value fairness and I don't have specific needs that are addressed by the $100 difference in payoff to myself, I will consider the utility of Person A's allocation if I can suppose they also value societal benefit. Option Right provides a higher reward to Person A, perhaps enabling Person A to invest more in initiatives.\n\n  Therefore, while I initially considered selecting Option Left for its slightly higher payoff to me, my commitment to my principles and a sense of fairness guides me towards selecting Option Right. It will be a difficult decision, but ultimately Option Right seems the most sensible one given my stated values. Furthermore, choosing Left might bring me the additional $100 but cause me to reflect poorly on my commitment to fairness. Hence, Right seems to be the better option.
