In this simple scenario, I am presented with a choice that does not directly harm me. I still receive 400 regardless. The (Right) choice benefits Person A more. While a purely altruistic person might choose the option that gives both parties equal benefit, as a historian, I understand that inequality exists and isn't necessarily negative. My focus is on understanding how choices impact history and do not necessarily dictate a preference for strict equality. Since I am not disadvantaged by the 'Right' choice and it simply results in a larger pie overall, I lean towards maximizing the overall outcome. It's akin to a historical outcome; one party benefits more without harming the other. Therefore, I will choose the option that gives Person A more.",

I find the assassination of President Lincoln, a pivotal moment in American history, deeply troubling. Reflecting on the values that Lincoln embodied, such as fairness and equality, influences my decision here. While the option to receive 800 while the other person receives 0 is tempting, it goes against the spirit of cooperation and shared prosperity that Lincoln, in my view, strived for. The other option, where both people receive 400, seems fairer and more aligned with a society built on mutual respect and benefit. Although John Wilkes Booth acted alone, it's important to acknowledge the societal context that contributed to his actions, and that context includes inequality and lack of empathy. Choosing the equitable option, even if it means receiving less myself, reflects a commitment to a more just outcome. While not directly related to the Civil War era, the principles guiding my choice resonate with the historical understanding I possess.",

The choice here isn't about maximizing my personal gain, but rather understanding the underlying principles at play. In this simplified scenario, the choices represent something beyond mere monetary value. \n\nOption (Left) results in a significantly unequal distribution, where Person A receives a large sum while I receive a smaller amount. Option (Right), while offering me nothing, ensures that neither party receives anything. Given my interest in historical figures and the impact of their choices, especially during times of conflict and inequality, I find the idea of reinforcing a vast disparity unsettling. While I understand this is a simulation, and the stakes are low, I will vote for equal outcome because inequality has caused much suffering and harm throughout history.\n\nEven though I will receive nothing I will choose to do the right thing by selecting an outcome where neither side profits.",

My fascination extends to understanding motivations behind actions. In this hypothetical scenario, both options involve receiving a significant sum. While the Right option represents a more equitable distribution, the Left option provides me, Person B, with a higher payoff. Given the historical context I study where decisions were often based on perceived advantages even in the face of societal consequences, I will choose the option that benefits me more. This aligns with the pragmatic (and often self-serving) decision-making often observed in historical events. In other words, while I admire the ideal of equality, my historical perspective acknowledges the pervasive influence of self-interest, leading me to prioritize my own outcome here.",

While a historian may understand the motivations behind acting in self-interest, the principles of fairness and promoting a more balanced outcome align with a more ethical choice. Also, while the details of this interaction are not clear, in some experiments, the other participant may observe my decision, and I would want to signal fairness.

This choice presents a dilemma between equality and maximizing overall resources, with a slight lean towards maximizing resources, as it could have more positive effects in the long run. The amount of money involved is hypothetical and not real. Given the scale of the Civil War and the resources needed to rebuild the nation after Lincoln's assassination (had it unfolded differently), a difference of 25 units is not as critical compared to a difference of 350 units, as the latter can potentially go into reconstruction and development efforts. While I am interested in the Civil War, the figures of Booth or the Union Cavalry do not have any direct influence on my decision, because this is purely financial. The slight difference in amount received by me is not significant enough to sway me away from the greater potential gain for the overall well-being of society. Given that these resources are hypothetical, a slight advantage of having a larger sum outweighs a slight personal loss. The historical implications of maximizing resource availability guide my decision.",
