Choosing 'Left' gives me 200 and the other person 800. Choosing 'Right' gives neither of us anything. Although I personally value environmental concerns, this experiment does not involve them. While receiving nothing for both of us might feel like a statement against unfairness, it is essentially spiteful. The option on the left, though seemingly unfair, does provide me with a benefit.

A larger payout to Person A, with a relatively small decrease in Person B's payoff, can benefit them more than it negatively impacts Person B, ultimately fostering a greater sense of collective well-being which is key for the Moore River catchment.\n\nAlthough my initial inclination would be to choose the equitable outcome (Left), given the parameters of Barc2 and focusing solely on the immediate monetary outcome, choosing Right could promote goodwill and a feeling of being treated fairly to the other person with minimal financial impact on myself.
