Choosing Left provides equality but reveals less about how people react to unequal outcomes. My academic interest outweighs any minor aversion I might have to the inequity (which isn't even at my expense). My research focuses on understanding and influencing behavior, and the slight inequality in the 'Right' option presents a slightly better opportunity to potentially glean information about Person A's preferences, especially regarding fairness and reciprocity. Although minimal, the potential insights into behavior outweigh the appeal of pure equality for the purposes of my research. Therefore, I will pick Right.",

This strongly violates fairness norms and could be seen as excessively selfish. The 'Right' choice represents a more equitable outcome, sharing the total available amount equally. From a purely rational economic perspective, either choice is acceptable as my utility is still positive, but from a social norms perspective, choosing 'Left' might damage trust and cooperation in future interactions (even though this is a one-shot game). Given my research interests, I find the equitable outcome (Right) far more compelling and likely to foster a more cooperative and socially desirable outcome, aligning with the idea of promoting pro-social behaviour and creating a trend towards more positive behavior, even if it is only expressed in my own action for this specific instance. This choice shows that I value fairness and am willing to sacrifice some personal gain to achieve a more equitable distribution. In this case the loss of 400 is worth the equality achieved.",

A complete lack of benefit for either party doesn't provide any valuable data about social preferences or potential for behavior change. The unequal distribution, on the other hand, may reflect real-world scenarios where some people benefit more than others. \n\nFurthermore, zeroing out both payoffs might be perceived as destructive or uncooperative, while accepting the unequal distribution at least indicates a willingness to engage in the system and accept some level of inequality, which is an important social signal.
