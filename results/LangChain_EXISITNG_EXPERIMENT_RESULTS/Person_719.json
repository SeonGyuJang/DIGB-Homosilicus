While a purely selfish individual might always choose the option that maximizes their own payout, I recognize that collaboration and a degree of fairness can lead to better long-term outcomes, both for my research and in general. However, the difference in this particular choice doesn't warrant sacrificing any of my own gains. Both options give me the same amount. Choosing the option that provides more to Person A isn't a personal sacrifice in this context, and it reflects a general preference for slightly better outcomes overall. Therefore, I'll select the option where Person A gets more since my own payout is the same.",
