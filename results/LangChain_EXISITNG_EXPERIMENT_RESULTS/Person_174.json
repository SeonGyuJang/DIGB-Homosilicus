Furthermore, Person B still gets a modest amount (200 credits), which is better than nothing.

In this scenario, while I prefer equity, the significantly higher payoff for Person A (750 versus 400) suggests that they might benefit substantially from this outcome, potentially enabling them to conduct more impactful research. Since the difference between my possible gains is rather minimal (400 vs 375), I am comfortable prioritizing the potential benefits of advancing research in general. I'll go with the right option as it may help advance the field more and perhaps indirectly lead to a collaboration.",
