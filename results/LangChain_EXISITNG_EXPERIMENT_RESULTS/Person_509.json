I value fairness and equitable distribution of resources in general. In this scenario, both options provide me with the same amount (400). The key difference is the amount Person A receives. Since the choice involves splitting resources without known context or justification for unequal allocations, choosing the equitable option feels more in line with my general principles. However, the amount is relatively small in the grand scheme of museum resources and does not materially impact the collection of the Royal College of Surgeons or Harvard Warren Anatomical Museum. Since there is no disadvantage to myself, I will choose the option that gives Person A more resources, with the understanding that this decision is made in the absence of further information about Person A's circumstances.",

This disparity, while beneficial to me, is less appealing than a more equitable outcome, even if it means receiving a slightly lower amount. The outcome on the right (600, 600) represents a more just and equitable division.

While I recognize the appeal of maximizing the total pie and potentially benefiting both players, my personal gain is the priority here.
