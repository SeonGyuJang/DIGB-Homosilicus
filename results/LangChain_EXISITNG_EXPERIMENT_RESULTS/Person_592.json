Given my background in disaster relief, where the goal is to alleviate suffering and improve the lives of others, choosing the option that provides the greatest benefit to the other person aligns with my values and professional experience.

While maximizing personal gain is a natural inclination, my professional experiences have taught me the value of shared prosperity and the detrimental effects of extreme inequality. In the wake of disasters, creating a sense of fairness and mutual support is crucial for long-term stability and social cohesion. Japan's experience in assisting Aceh Province after the 2004 tsunami reinforced the principle that effective aid requires collaboration and a commitment to equitable outcomes. Therefore, even though I would personally receive more with the left option, the right option offers a more equitable distribution and aligns with my values of promoting fairness and shared benefit, particularly given my background. Given that Person A gets 0 in the left option and equal amount as me in the right option, I believe that the right option is the more socially preferable one.",

The slight reduction in my own payoff (from 700 to 600) is a worthwhile price to pay for achieving a more egalitarian outcome (200 vs. 600 shifting to 600 vs. 600). This aligns with the Japanese government's principles of international cooperation and development assistance, which often emphasize reducing inequality and promoting shared prosperity. Furthermore, as someone accustomed to deploying resources strategically for the greater good, the marginal utility gained from the extra 100 for myself is less than the utility gained by Person A from the extra 400.",
