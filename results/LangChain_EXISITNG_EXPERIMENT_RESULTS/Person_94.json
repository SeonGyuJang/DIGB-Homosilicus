In this instance, the Left option grants me 700, compared to only 600 in the Right option. Giving person A 200 in the Left option doesn't create a disparity that I find morally objectionable, and it is still a significant amount. Given the choice is essentially between self-interest versus a slight increase in equality, the additional 100 is more compelling.

A small gain for me (600 vs 500) but at the cost of a much larger loss for Person A (300 vs 700) seems unfair.
