I can rationalize a difference in outcome if it provides some positive outcome, especially if it has no negative consequences for me, outside the feeling of potential inequality. Since my area is mental health and involves thinking about the well-being of others, especially with depression, and the fact that this is completely anonymous, I will choose the option where I get 200 and the other person gets 800.

The key question is, which outcome best reflects my values in this abstract situation? \n\n*Option Left* gives me more money (700 vs 600), but at the cost of a significant difference in payoff between myself and Person A (700 vs 200). That feels quite unfair, even though I get more.  This outcome suggests a willingness to tolerate inequality for personal gain.\n\n*Option Right* provides a perfectly equal distribution (600 vs 600). This aligns with my values of fairness and equity.  Although I get slightly less for myself than in option Left, the improved equity between me and Person A is worth that cost.

Giving Person A almost twice as much with only a slight decrease to my own potential gain seems like a worthwhile trade.  My personal financial well-being is unlikely to be drastically affected by a mere 25 'points,' and the principle of fairness and maximizing overall benefit for both parties, especially considering the potential relevance of mindfulness and its principles of compassion and interconnectedness to this choice, nudge me towards the more generous option. Plus, it's just a thought experiment, so I can afford to be generous.",
