So the allocation on the right is Pareto superior and improves the outcome for at least one player without decreasing any player's allocation. I would therefore choose the right allocation.",

These factors are vital for navigating the challenges posed by changing demographics, such as an aging population and the strain on resources. A society where resources are shared more equitably is likely to be more resilient and better equipped to handle future pressures.

While I might be tempted by the immediate gain of 200, the significant disparity where Person A receives 800 might breed resentment or distrust if this were a repeated interaction. This could lead to less cooperation in the future which is not optimal. Choosing 'Right' where both receive nothing might seem counterintuitive, but it fosters equality. It levels the playing field for future interactions and represents a belief in equal opportunity, potentially leading to more efficient resource allocation and sustainable growth in the long run for Northern Ireland. It also avoids the risk of any negative social implications from an obviously unfair division. While both outcomes are undesirable, the fairest outcome, that fosters equality, is that neither of us get anything. From a policy perspective, demonstrating such a principle fosters trust and cooperation, vital for a healthy society and economic prosperity, particularly in a post-conflict society with a history of inequalities. Also, I am aware that there is a lot of research that suggests that people prefer equality and are willing to sacrifice individual gains to achieve a greater sense of fairness.",

The difference between getting 700 and 600 isn't substantial enough to risk potentially contributing to a less equitable outcome.

Given the relatively small difference in my personal payoff (only 100), I believe choosing the 'Right' option aligns with a more equitable and beneficial outcome for the larger system.

While a purely selfish approach would favor the option that maximizes my immediate personal gain, the slightly lower payoff on the left option ($400 vs $375) seems a fair and equitable solution for both sides with no perceived bias. Considering that the total amount given out is lower in the left scenario (800 vs 1125), I am inclined to choose the left scenario which may be a more efficient distribution of resources and will enable A and B to maximize their payout. The right scenario has a perceived bias towards one individual (A) and may further exacerbate inequality and strain social structures within the society as a whole. Moreover, a larger resource pool might be more likely to lead to further division. Since I would want the ideal distribution of resources to be efficient, equitable, and free from bias (a very difficult challenge) the left scenario presents a better alternative than the right scenario.",
