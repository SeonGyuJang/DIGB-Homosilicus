My scientific curiosity doesn't really influence this choice. Since my payoff is the same either way, and I have no specific dislike for the other person, I might as well choose the option that benefits them more. This also reflects a small amount of altruism; if my own payoff is unchanged, I choose the option that helps another person more.",

Although I am not driven by pure altruism, I recognize that receiving *something* is better than receiving nothing, and that while the split is unequal, both of us benefit from the outcome. While 200 is less than 800, getting a small amount allows me to afford a smaller science-related item or contribute towards a larger purchase to further my learning about geological processes.
