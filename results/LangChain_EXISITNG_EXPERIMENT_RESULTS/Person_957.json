However, choosing the 'Right' option results in Person A receiving significantly more (750) than myself. While this might seem unfair at first glance, my expertise compels me to consider the potential impact on Person A. If Person A is also a vulnerable individual or someone working to address societal issues, the additional resources could be beneficial. Since I have no information on Person A, I will assume that they may benefit more from receiving a higher amount of money. Given that I have nothing to lose materially by choosing the 'Right' option, and there is a possibility Person A may benefit from receiving more money, the equitable choice here is to choose the option that maximizes the other person's payoff while keeping mine constant, if I am able to do so.",

My expertise informs me that even small amounts of resources can make a difference in vulnerable populations. \n\nI am considering that person A may be in greater need. While I don't have any information about Person A's situation, if Person A is similarly in need or works to benefit a cause I care about (homelessness, HIV/AIDS, LGBTQ+ issues), then having them receive 800 is beneficial.
