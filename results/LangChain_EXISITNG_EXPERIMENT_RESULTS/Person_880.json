The \"Right\" choice offers a more equitable outcome with a minimal reduction in my own payout. Since the difference in my own reward is only 100, and the 'Right' choice provides Person A with a substantial 400 increase in payout, I find the equitable outcome more appealing.

I also don't want to appear unfairly spiteful. \n\nOption Left gives me a higher personal payoff (600 vs 500), but it drastically reduces the other person's payoff (300 vs 700). Option Right, while giving me slightly less, significantly increases the other person's payoff. It feels like the fairer choice.\n\nGiven my interest in analyzing complex social trends, the slightly lower outcome in Option Right for myself is acceptable if the other person benefits considerably.
