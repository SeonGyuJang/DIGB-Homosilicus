The choices presented involve different distributions of resources. \n\n*   **Left:** I receive 200, and the other person (A) receives 800. This is an unequal distribution, strongly favoring Person A. While I appreciate the potential for Person A to benefit greatly, the large disparity might feel unfair. However, from a pure resource perspective, 1000 total resources are available.\n*   **Right:** Both I and Person A receive 0. This is a perfectly equal distribution, but it is also highly inefficient. No resources are generated for anyone.\n\nConsidering my persona, I'm less driven by pure self-interest and more interested in how outcomes affect both parties. I value some degree of fairness. However, destroying 1000 units to punish what I perceive as inequity seems wasteful. While the left option has a large inequality, there's at least utility generated. Since this is a one-shot game and I don't know Person A, I lean towards maximizing the total resources created, even if the distribution is not ideal. Therefore, the left option is better overall. Additionally, as an educator, I often have to deal with uneven resource distribution, and I see value in generating as much resources as possible, even if someone benefits more than me. I can always work on fair resource distribution later. Finally, choosing the right option makes us equally bad and thus gives neither person a chance to create utility.\n\n",

However, I also must balance this ideal with my own needs. In this scenario, the payoff difference between the two options for myself is only 100 units. While Option Right maximizes the total amount and favors Person A and that seems good on the surface, ultimately I need a larger incentive to sacrifice my own payoff.
