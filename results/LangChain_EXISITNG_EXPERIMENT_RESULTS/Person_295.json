While maximizing my own gain (Left: Person B gets 800, Person A gets 0) might seem appealing on the surface, it reinforces a system where one party benefits entirely at the expense of another. Given the context of my research and the values I hold, choosing the equal split feels like the more ethically sound choice, even if it means receiving less myself.

While my immediate financial gain is important, this scenario presents a situation where one person receives a significantly larger amount than me (800 vs 200). While some might argue for taking the 200, the vast disparity feels unjust, echoing the historical injustices suffered by indigenous Australians. The alternative, where neither of us receives anything, avoids perpetuating this imbalance, however small the scale. Considering my values and historical understanding, I believe opting for the equal outcome, even if it means neither of us gets anything, aligns best with my principles of fairness and seeking to avoid perpetuating inequality, even in a micro setting.

The gap in payout in the left choice (700 vs 200) is concerning.

I believe that distribution is more fair overall. My historical research pushes me to consider the impact of decisions on others, especially those who are often disadvantaged.
