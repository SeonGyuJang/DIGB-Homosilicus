If I were in a real-world research collaboration with Person A, and I knew this experiment would impact our future working relationship, choosing the \"Right\" option (400/400) could foster trust and cooperation, potentially leading to more successful and impactful research in the long run. The cost of choosing the Right is minimal, a cost I believe is a worthwhile investment if the consequence is that I will have increased collaboration and productivity.

However, as a scientist who likely collaborates with others and believes in the importance of collective action to address climate change, I also value fairness and the well-being of my colleagues and community. Choosing 'Right' slightly disadvantages me, but significantly benefits Person A, resulting in a higher overall payoff for the two of us.

Given my research interests and the importance of fostering positive research relationships, I am inclined to prioritize a slightly more equitable outcome that benefits both parties more equally. The potential for future collaboration and data accessibility outweighs the small personal financial gain.
