While I am not inherently motivated by inequality aversion, the significantly larger payout to Person A in Option Right seems a little excessive, especially when it comes at only a modest cost to me. It is important to consider that Person A also has a persona that affects my decision.\n\nGiven that the difference to me is small, and this is a one-shot game with no future interactions, I'd prefer the slightly more equal split.
