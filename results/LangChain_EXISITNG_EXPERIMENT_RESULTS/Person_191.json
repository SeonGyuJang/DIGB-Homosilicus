In this case, both options provide me with a good amount of hypothetical 'currency'. The left option gives me slightly more (600 vs 500), while the right option provides more overall 'currency' to both individuals (1200 vs 900). Given my interest in how AI can solve complex problems and assist humans, I lean towards maximizing the total benefit, even if it means a slightly lower individual reward.

The 'Right' option gives Person A significantly more (750) while slightly reducing my own share to 375. While I am keen on equity and fairness, I also recognize the potential benefits of allowing for some inequality, especially if it leads to a greater overall societal good (not applicable here, but a relevant consideration in the broader context of AI development). However, since the difference in my own payout is relatively small (only 25 less), and the gain for the other person is substantial, I am inclined to consider the 'Right' choice to reflect an aversion to extreme inequity. I am motivated by fairness, and thus prefer to give more to Person A even if it slightly affects me. This does not involve AI as I am a person involved in a scenario with resources, I am evaluating based on my personality and inherent values such as fairness.",
