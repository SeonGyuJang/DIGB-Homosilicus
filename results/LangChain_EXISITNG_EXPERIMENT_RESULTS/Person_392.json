Choosing 'Right' would result in neither of us receiving anything. \n\nWhile I value fairness and equitable distribution, the option where both parties receive nothing is not productive. As my primary goal is to support the broader education community, having some gain (even if relatively small compared to Person A's gain) could potentially allow me to further my work in integrating STEM careers into the curriculum. The 200 I receive might be used for purchasing some relevant material. Choosing 'Left' would also mean person A (potentially another educator or organization focused on education) would benefit a lot more. Therefore, choosing the 'Left' seems to be the best option, as it leads to some positive outcome, especially for person A, which is better than no outcome for anyone.\n\n",

Promoting equity aligns with my values as an educator, and demonstrating a willingness to share resources fairly, even if it means a small personal sacrifice, is important for setting a positive example for my students and colleagues.
