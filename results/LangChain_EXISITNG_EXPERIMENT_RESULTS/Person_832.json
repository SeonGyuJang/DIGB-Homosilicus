The 'Right' choice, where we both receive 400, represents a fairer distribution and a rejection of the ruthless self-interest that pervades Macbeth's actions. While I appreciate the practical benefits of research funding (which 800 could conceivably facilitate), I believe upholding a sense of fairness and cooperation aligns better with a morally sound perspective, and is arguably less likely to lead to metaphorical (or literal!) daggers in the dark. The third murderer, often overlooked, reminds us that even seemingly small acts of complicity in inequity can have significant consequences. Therefore, I choose the equitable distribution.",

Option (Right) is a nihilistic outcome where no one gains anything. While my research delves into the darker aspects of human nature, I also recognize the value of positive outcomes, even if imperfectly distributed. Choosing (Left) allows for a potential benefit to be realized, which aligns with a nuanced understanding of human nature that acknowledges the existence of both good and evil, gain and loss. Although the allocation is uneven, it avoids a complete loss. The third murderer in *Macbeth* often represents a choice between loyalty (to Macbeth) and self-preservation. In this scenario, option (Left) could be seen as a similar, complex decision: do I prioritize the possibility of some benefit (however small) to myself, even if it entails a larger benefit for another? Option (Right) resembles the destructive aftermath of Macbeth's actions â€“ utter ruin for all. Therefore, I choose the option that yields something positive, however skewed the distribution may be, echoing the complex interplay of motivations and consequences within *Macbeth*.",

Choosing 'Right' offers a sense of equality and perhaps even collaboration. While 'Left' gives me more money, it creates a significant disparity. My research into the motivations of characters like the third murderer in Macbeth leads me to believe that maintaining a sense of fairness and avoiding undue power imbalances is crucial for social harmony and avoiding conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the difference of only 100 is small. In the grand scheme of things, a commitment to equity seems more valuable than the small financial advantage offered by the 'Left' choice. Macbeth's downfall came about because of his pursuit of personal gain. Let's avoid that.",

Ambition, that serpent coiling in Macbeth's breast, might whisper, 'Seize the advantage! Let him suffer the slighter sum!' But 'Macbeth' also cautions against the corrosive power of unchecked greed and the ruin it brings. \n\nThe right path, though granting me a lesser 500, bestows upon Person A a more generous 700. It echoes the themes of fairness and perhaps, in a small way, redresses the imbalance inherent in some of Shakespeare's hierarchies. To choose the right, though sacrificing personal gain, is to acknowledge the shared humanity that binds us, a lesson Macbeth tragically fails to learn. Furthermore, in seeking to understand the motivations of figures like the third murderer, I must examine the choices made under duress or swayed by circumstance. A generous action, even a seemingly small one, can illuminate deeper societal structures and the delicate dance between self-interest and altruism. \n\nConsidering the weight of Shakespearean precedent, the potential for social good, and the lessons woven into the fabric of 'Macbeth' itself, I choose the path that favors a more equitable distribution, even at a personal cost.",

Choosing the 'Right' option, though seemingly advantageous, could have unknown implications in the context of this experiment.
