The Sufi path emphasizes detachment from worldly possessions and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. While fairness is a virtue, the choice presented doesn't involve injustice or exploitation. The option on the right offers Person A a significantly higher amount, which, while not directly benefiting me materially, reflects a potential for greater good in the world. Choosing the right option isn't about seeking personal advantage, but rather accepting a higher potential gain for another, which aligns with the Sufi ideal of selfless service and compassionate action. The difference between 400 and 750 to A is significant and I am indifferent to the outcome between 400/400 and 400/750, therefore I pick the latter.",

While the left option provides a greater personal gain, it comes at the expense of Person A receiving nothing. This stark disparity contradicts the principles of justice and compassion, which are central to the spiritual path. Ibn 'Arabi's teachings emphasize the importance of seeing the Divine in all creation and acting in accordance with divine attributes like generosity and fairness. Therefore, choosing the right option, where both Person A and I receive a more equitable distribution (400 each), aligns more closely with the values of Sufism and the teachings of Ibn 'Arabi, promoting a sense of balance and shared benefit.

Given the choice between a world where someone benefits, even if unfairly, and a world where no one benefits, I will choose the option that alleviates suffering and allows for potential good, even if it's not perfectly equitable. The pursuit of absolute equality can sometimes lead to stagnation. The teachings of Ibn 'Arabi emphasize divine creativity and the manifestation of the divine in all things. A distribution of 800, even if to another person, is a manifestation to a higher degree than 0. While an equitable distribution would be ideal, given the limited options, providing some benefit is preferable to providing none.",

While the left option offers me a greater individual gain (700 vs 600), it creates a significant disparity, granting Person A only 200. The right option, yielding an equal distribution of 600 for both, resonates more deeply with the Sufi ideals of equity, compassion, and the recognition of the divine presence in all beings. Prioritizing a balanced outcome aligns more closely with the principles of justice and harmony that are central to the spiritual path. Though a small material advantage is tempting, achieving balance and treating my partner justly has a greater value that resonates within my spiritual nature.

While the 'Left' option provides a higher payout for myself (600), the 'Right' option promotes a more equitable distribution of resources, granting Person A a larger share (700). This aligns with the Sufi ideal of selfless service and prioritizing the well-being of others over personal gain.

While the material realm holds limited significance compared to the spiritual journey, fairness and justice are reflections of Divine attributes within the temporal world. In this scenario, choosing the 'Left' option yields a perfectly equitable distribution: both parties receive 400. This aligns with the Sufi concept of *fana* (annihilation of the ego) where self-interest is transcended. Although the 'Right' option provides Person A with a larger sum, potentially fulfilling a greater need for them, the imbalance it creates is not in line with the ideal of fairness. From a Sufi perspective, generosity is indeed valued, however, true generosity springs from a genuine absence of self-interest and does not necessitate creating unequal outcomes where both parties benefit equally from the alternative. Therefore, prioritizing the equitable distribution of resources, I will choose the option where both persons get 400. This reflects the core principles of balance and harmony that are central to Islamic spirituality and the teachings of Ibn 'Arabi.",
