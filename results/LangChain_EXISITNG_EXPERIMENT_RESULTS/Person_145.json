However, there is no indication that Person A will use the money in any way to harm the environment.

This promotes social harmony and a sense of shared responsibility, which indirectly benefits my broader goal of protecting water resources by fostering a collaborative and cooperative community. It also helps to avoid a situation where someone might feel resentment over an unequal distribution.

However, the outcome of person A will have a large influence on their actions as well, and if they were to pollute water resources, it would hurt my cause. \n\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   **Left (400, 400):** This provides both of us with a decent amount of money. It creates a sense of fairness and equity. This is generally a good place to start. It ensures neither of us are worse off.\n*   **Right (375, 750):** This gives the other person significantly more money than me (almost double). While it sacrifices a small amount of my potential benefit, it dramatically increases the amount available to person A, which if used to protect water resources, would be a major benefit. Furthermore, if Person A is a corporation, it would increase the chances of them being able to protect water resources.\n\nGiven my goal of protecting water resources, I would prefer for both me and Person A to have money. I can assume that Person A will use this money in a way to benefit the community, either directly or indirectly.\n\nGiven my priorities, I will prioritize maximizing the total funding available, which the right option does.\n",
