The 'Right' option distributes the resources more equitably, giving both myself and Person A a significant 400. While the 'Left' option yields a higher immediate benefit, I am going to choose the 'Right' option because as a healthcare professional, I value equity in terms of holistic health and wellness. This supports my belief that everyone should have access to resources that promotes physical and mental wellbeing.

However, the primary driver is that I, as Person B, receive 200 units in the 'Left' choice.

While the principle of equity might suggest choosing Right, the difference in my own payout (100) is significant enough to outweigh the fairness consideration, especially if these resources can be used to further my understanding and practice of holistic health and detoxification techniques to benefit more people in the long run.
