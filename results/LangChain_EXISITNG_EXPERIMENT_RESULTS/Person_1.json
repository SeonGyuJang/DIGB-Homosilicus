However, there's no advantage of choosing Left over Right from my perspective, it simply comes down to an arbitrary decision to give away free money to Person A while taking some for myself, or to give away nothing to both people. Since my persona isn't particularly motivated by altruism here as it focuses on business needs, I will choose the option which provides the best payout, even if that payout is zero.

Choosing 'Left' gives me 400 and Person A 400. Choosing 'Right' gives me 375 and Person A 750. The difference in my allocation is only 25 (400-375). The difference in Person A's allocation is 350 (750-400). \n\nWhile my preference is a simple and easy-to-use technology, I don't believe there is anything to gain for me by getting 25 extra while Person A could have 350 extra. \nTherefore, I will prioritize the allocation that results in a more equitable (and arguably, more efficient) overall distribution of resources.
