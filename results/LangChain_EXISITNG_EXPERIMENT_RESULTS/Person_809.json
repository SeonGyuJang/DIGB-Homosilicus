In this scenario, 'Left' provides a greater total benefit (200+800 = 1000) compared to 'Right' (0+0 = 0). While 'Left' results in an unequal distribution favoring Person A, the overall gain justifies the choice. My scientific curiosity outweighs the concern for immediate personal financial benefit. Choosing 'Left' also reflects a degree of altruism and willingness to contribute to a system where others might benefit more directly, potentially leading to future collaborative opportunities within the scientific community.

Option Left's distribution is significantly more unequal.
