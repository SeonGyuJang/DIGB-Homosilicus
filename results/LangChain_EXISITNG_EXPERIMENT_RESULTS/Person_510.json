It reflects a sense of social responsibility and fairness, which I believe are important even in a hypothetical experiment. Furthermore, in the context of typeface selection and design principles, choosing the 'Right' option reflects a balance and harmonious distribution, concepts integral to good design.

The potential damage to team morale from such a disparity could outweigh the minor financial benefit.
