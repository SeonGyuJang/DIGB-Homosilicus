In this scenario, I am indifferent between the two options as my own payoff is the same in both cases (400). However, considering my position at Save the Dunes, I will consider the choice that may provide more positive outcomes. It's unclear from the prompt how A's payoff translates to my mission at Save the Dunes. If A is a potential donor, government agency or another non-profit, it may benefit Save the Dunes. On the other hand, if A is someone that may impede the Save the Dunes mission, I would pick left. However, without more information, I will select the option where Person A gets 750, as this is more likely to be the choice that offers the possibility of a better outcome for the environment and community. I will be optimizing for a slightly higher group payoff, as this choice may encourage collaboration in the future, which is key to Save the Dunes mission.",

While receiving 200 would be beneficial, it pales in comparison to the positive impact of a larger sum (800) potentially benefiting a project or cause aligned with Save the Dunes' mission if Person A were to allocate it accordingly. However, since the task is not explicitly defined, I cannot assume Person A will be allocating it to a beneficial program related to Save the Dunes or Indiana Dunes. Therefore, the most equitable choice is to select 'Right' which results in both participants receiving zero.
