While material wealth wasn't the sole measure of a person's worth, maintaining social harmony and ensuring that everyone within the community had enough was considered paramount. \n\nIn this scenario, both choices ensure I receive 400. The difference lies in what Person A receives. The option on the Left provides an equal distribution, reflecting a sense of community and fairness. The option on the Right grants Person A a significantly larger share. While I wouldn't begrudge another's good fortune, the idea of a pronounced imbalance feels less aligned with the values of *cydraddoldeb* (equality) and *hawl* (fair share) which, while not always perfectly implemented in the medieval period, served as an ideal towards which we strove. The Mabinogion often showcase characters who demonstrate generosity and concern for the well-being of others, even when faced with difficult choices. Choosing the Left option reinforces this value.\n\nTherefore, while the outcome for me is the same in both cases, the ethical weight leans heavily towards the Left option due to its promotion of equal shares between us, better reflecting what I consider a fair or equal outcome.",

The tale of Pwyll, for example, demonstrates the virtue of generosity even at personal cost. Furthermore, to deny another any recompense while hoarding plenty would be akin to a miser guarding gold while a bard sings a mournful elegy for generosity lost. Therefore, though a small amount is shared, it is far preferable to the sin of greed. Thus, I choose the option which brings benefit to both parties, even if it means a lesser share for myself.",

The option on the right, however, results in nothing for either of us. It is a barren outcome, devoid of any potential for good. While I am no stranger to the concept of sacrifice, absolute zero is unacceptable. Even with a slightly less-than-ideal distribution, the left option at least allows for the possibility of using the 800 to foster the preservation of Welsh literature or support the arts. So, while the unequal distribution rankles a bit, I must choose the option that holds the most potential for positive impact, however small.",

The Mabinogion teaches us about reciprocity, loyalty, and the dangers of greed and excessive self-interest. Selecting the 'Right' option, which provides both myself and Person A with an equal share of 600, aligns more closely with the principles of fairness, social cohesion, and community spirit that are integral to the Welsh literary tradition and the moral lessons found within the Mabinogion. Though my personal reward is somewhat lessened, upholding a sense of fairness feels paramount.",

The tales themselves, while filled with magic and strife, often revolve around themes of honour, loyalty, and the importance of kinship. While personal gain is understandable, an egregious imbalance, especially one that disadvantages another, clashes with the spirit of these narratives. Although I, Person B, would receive a slightly higher reward with the 'Left' option (600), the 'Right' option (Person B gets 500, Person A gets 700) provides a more equitable distribution, even if it means I receive less. The larger benefit to Person A outweighs the slight decrease for myself, reflecting a preference for a more just outcome. It's not about altruism in the purest sense, but about choosing an option that better aligns with the societal values reflected in our ancient stories and the development of Welsh literature. It reflects a sense of 'cyfran' or 'share' – the notion of a fair apportionment. Furthermore, given that the difference for me is only 100, and the benefit to A is 400 greater than me with 'Left', the choice is clear. 'Gwell yw cymod na chynnen' - 'Better is reconciliation than strife'. A difference of 200 between us is less likely to breed resentment. I choose the 'Right' option.",

On the one hand, both options provide enough to keep a scholar in ink and vellum for some time, and perhaps even a flagon or two of mead. However, the choice is not merely about material gain, but about the preservation of *cyfiawnder* – justice – albeit on a rather small scale.\n\n  Let us consider the 'Left' option: a harmonious equilibrium, both A and I receiving 400. There is a certain inherent *harmonia* there, reminiscent of the balanced narratives within the Four Branches. No blatant disparity, no suggestion of one being favored over the other. A respectable outcome.\n\n  Now, the 'Right' option. I receive 375, slightly less than the first option, while Person A receives a considerably larger sum, 750. While not inherently *drwg* – evil – the disparity is notable. As one well-versed in tales of kings and commoners, of heroes and villains, I have seen the dangers of unearned and unequal distribution of wealth. Such arrangements, while not unheard of in the annals of Welsh history, often lead to discord and instability, much like the consequences of Pryderi's rash actions in the Mabinogion!\n\n  While the pursuit of knowledge and the celebration of Welsh heritage is my primary ambition, I am also aware that a society built on principles of fairness and a strong oral tradition thrives on shared prosperity. As the legendary Taliesin himself might advise, 'Let wisdom prevail, but let justice be the guide.' Therefore, although I could personally benefit from the Right option, my principles, cultivated from years of studying our rich literature, compel me to choose the more egalitarian option. Perhaps Person A can use their share to commission a new *areithiau* in my honor!\n\n  Thus, though a scholar's life is often spent in pursuit of knowledge, a sense of balanced fairness is a worthy aspiration.\n\n",
