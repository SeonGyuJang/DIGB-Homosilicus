A choice that offers Person A something creates goodwill and potential for future cooperation or knowledge sharing. Getting 400 for myself and giving 400 to Person A strikes a balance between self-interest and fostering a positive relationship, which aligns with my vision of building a robust and collaborative network within the industry. A good business relationship is more important than solely maximizing my own gain in this single interaction.

This option gives me a positive outcome but also creates a significant disparity. While I'm not intrinsically against earning less than someone else if it benefits me, the magnitude of the difference raises concerns about fairness. However, the additive manufacturing world is competitive, and the fact that both have positive outcomes will be something that might impact my decision.\n\nOption Right: Person B gets 0, Person A gets 0. This option results in equality, but at the cost of both of us receiving nothing. From a purely rational self-interest perspective, this is worse than receiving 200.\n\nGiven my persona as a CEO focused on creating value and fostering collaboration, I believe a pragmatic approach is best. Receiving 200 is beneficial. While the disparity is large, it's not explicitly stated that Person A's gain is directly at my expense or related to my business ventures. Therefore, I will choose the option that provides me with a positive outcome, even if it means Person A receives significantly more.",

This promotes trust and collaboration, which are crucial for successful long-term partnerships in the aerospace industry. Furthermore, it aligns with a vision of ethical leadership and building a company culture that values fairness.

A potential long-term partnership with Person A could result from being perceived as equitable and beneficial to them. In the complex and interconnected world of aerospace manufacturing, positive relationships are crucial. However, since this is a single interaction (implied in Barc2), my inherent altruism is tempered by the fact that this won't directly affect my company, clients or vision.
