In this scenario, both choices give me 400. The 'Right' choice gives the other person a significantly larger amount (750). While 'Left' provides an equal split (400/400), I don't see a reason to actively prevent the other person from receiving more, especially since it doesn't harm me.

This reinforces existing inequalities and doesn't align with my values.\n\nOption Right offers a more equitable distribution, with both Person A and Person B receiving 600.
