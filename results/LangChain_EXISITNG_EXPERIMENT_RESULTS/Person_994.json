Both options give me the same amount (400), and while Person A gets more in the 'Right' option, it doesn't negatively impact me. Choosing 'Right' is, therefore, a rational choice, as it contributes to a larger overall sum for both participants without diminishing my own outcome. I don't feel any need to punish Person A by choosing the option that results in a lower payoff for them, especially when it doesn't affect my own gain. The fact that my payoff is identical regardless of my choice means I'm indifferent to the two options, but I will choose the option that gives Person A more.",

The 'right' option, while fair in distributing nothing to either party, feels like a complete loss. It doesn't contribute to any potential positive outcome. Since I get some value from 'Left' and I'm interested in seeing the study participants make choices that are more than purely altruistic, I'll choose the option where I get something, which is the 'Left' option. Besides, receiving 200 is better than nothing. This choice acknowledges the social aspect of the experiment – the interaction with Person A – even if it's unequal. If 'Left' is chosen by many, maybe the outcome will be studied more. If 'Right' is chosen, nothing will be gained. Maybe the study will determine something such as 'People hate to be given a bad hand so they'd rather no one get anything.'",
