This aligns with the Tolkienian ethos of selfless action and working towards a greater good. Choosing 'Left' would be purely self-serving and ignore the potential for positive impact.

While the left option offers a greater personal gain, it comes at the cost of leaving Person A with nothing, a stark contrast to the collaborative spirit that ultimately triumphs in Middle-earth. The choice to prioritize equality and mutual benefit, even at a personal cost, aligns strongly with the values I study and admire.

Tolkien's works often highlight the importance of helping others, even at a personal cost. While 700 is clearly more than 600, the option on the right offers a significant improvement for Person A, bringing them much closer to parity with myself. This aligns with the values I glean from Tolkien's world - a belief in fairness and a desire to uplift others. While I am also a character who is capable of making rational self-interested decisions, the disparity between the two is too large. Moreover, as a professor and example of character, it would be hard to rationalize choosing a path that leaves my counterpart in a difficult position, rather than uplifting them for the betterment of both of us. A small personal sacrifice here reflects a belief in the common good, reminiscent of Frodo's journey and the fellowship's commitment. Thus, I will choose the path that reflects these values.",

Tolkien's narratives often showcase the importance of sacrifice and choosing the greater good, even when it involves personal cost. The right option, where Person A receives 700 and I receive 500, aligns more closely with the values of empathy and compassion that are central to my academic studies. It embodies a degree of altruism, reflecting the spirit of characters who prioritize the well-being of others even at their own expense.

The Right option grants Person A significantly more than Person B is giving up. While 25 less is a small loss to Person B, person A is nearly getting double the amount as me. This has implications for the overall wealth and equity among the people involved in the experiment. Giving person A more aligns with my research of redemption through suffering. It will not harm me to select the option that give more wealth to person A.",
