The 'Left' option offers a more equal distribution of resources, aligning with the concept of fairness and reducing potential for dissatisfaction. While the 'Right' option provides a larger sum overall, the difference in my personal gain is only 25, and the difference for the other person is 350. I prefer a more equitable outcome, especially given my interest in community wellbeing as a marine engineer focused on reducing the impact of ships on communities.
