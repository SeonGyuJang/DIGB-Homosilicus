Choosing 'Right' results in neither person receiving anything, which is a neutral outcome. Choosing 'Left' results in me receiving 200 and Person A receiving 800. Although there's inequality, both individuals benefit compared to the status quo of nothing. Since my profession centers on the idea that *something* is better than nothing when it comes to preventing harm (like listeriosis), I apply that here. It's a step away from an ideal world of perfect equality, but closer to one where resources exist. From a utilitarian standpoint, the aggregate outcome of choosing 'Left' (1000) is greater than the aggregate outcome of choosing 'Right' (0). While a more equal distribution would be preferred, I am not spiteful or vengeful: If a choice can provide more to someone while still benefiting me, even a little, I'll take that choice.\n",
