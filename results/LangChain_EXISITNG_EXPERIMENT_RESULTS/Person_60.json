The core question is whether I prioritize equal distribution or accept inequality for a higher outcome for the other person. The prompt does not give any context about my relationship to person A. Since the choice between getting 400 regardless, is indifferent and the only difference is in Person A's gains, I'd pick the option where Person A benefits more. A slight benefit to Person A comes at no cost to me. It might be argued, that as a Linguist, I value fairness, and hence would pick the equal allocation, however the question asks to pick from the options provided, and hence indifference for my outcome is the crucial component here, so I pick the higher outcome for Person A.",

While a purely selfish perspective might lean slightly towards the left option for a small gain, my professional values, emphasizing fairness and equitable access, lead me to favor the right option.
