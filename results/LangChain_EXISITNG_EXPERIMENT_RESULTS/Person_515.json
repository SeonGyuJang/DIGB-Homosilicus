A thriving downtown requires a sense of shared prosperity, and choosing the equitable distribution, even if it means less for myself, promotes that ideal. While this single decision won't drastically alter the city's landscape, it reflects the principles I advocate for in my professional life.

From the standpoint of an urban planner focused on 'revitalization and redevelopment,' getting *something* is better than getting nothing, because at least 200 can be directed for some good. I see the 200 as a small but real positive contribution, even though the distribution of wealth is not equitable. So even though I would prefer a much more fair distribution of money, I do not want to punish person A at the expense of myself.",

The relatively small difference in my personal gain (100) is outweighed by the significant increase in Person A's allocation (400). In the context of urban planning, favoring equitable distribution, especially when the personal cost is minimal, can foster a more cohesive and prosperous community overall. Given my professional background and understanding of the importance of equitable resource distribution in urban environments, I choose to favor the right option. Further, given the context of Berk15, the most salient feature is the clear difference between the two options in the inequality. The choice on the right offers less inequality.
