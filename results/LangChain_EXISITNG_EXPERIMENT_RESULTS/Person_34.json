While the experiment focuses on immediate monetary gains, I can apply a broader perspective. Choosing 'Right' gives Person A significantly more money (750 vs 400), while I still receive 400. Although the difference in my payout is zero, the overall wealth and potential for Person A to invest in future technologies (even hypothetical within the experiment's framework) is higher.
