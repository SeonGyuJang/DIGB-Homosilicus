Choosing 'Right' means Person A receives significantly more (750) than I do, while choosing 'Left' results in equal distribution (400 each). Given my profession's emphasis on impartiality and the fact that both options benefit me equally, I should not take more money from Person A to gain a perceived advantage of fairness. Also, the amount is not significant and so as to not be spiteful or unfair, I should choose the option that benefits everyone. Therefore, maximizing total payout in this situation is a justifiable move.",

In this scenario, choosing 'Left' provides a larger personal gain (800 vs 400), but it results in Person A receiving nothing. Choosing 'Right' provides a smaller personal gain (400), but provides Person A with 400 as well, promoting fairness. Given my professional emphasis on financial integrity and preventing harm, I would lean towards promoting a more equitable outcome, even at a personal cost. However, the difference is quite large. I am also concerned that if person A receives nothing, and feels treated unfairly, they might be inclined to do something dishonest or illegal in the future. If the difference was smaller, I would definitely choose 'Right', but it's hard to pass up 800 over 400. Since this isn't 'real money' (in the experiment), I can be generous and choose the fairer split without incurring any real-world personal harm.",

The Right choice offers a more equitable distribution, with both parties receiving a substantial amount.

The right option, while giving me slightly less, provides nearly double the amount to Person A, creating a more equitable distribution. Given my profession and the emphasis on fairness and accuracy, I will choose the option that benefits both parties even if it means a slight reduction in my own payout.\n\nAlso, from the perspective of risk management (another aspect of a bank examiner's role), the difference between 400 and 375 is minimal, and accepting this slight reduction avoids the potential negative consequences associated with appearing greedy or unfair. Maintaining a fair and professional image is crucial, especially in a role that involves assessing the integrity of financial systems.",
