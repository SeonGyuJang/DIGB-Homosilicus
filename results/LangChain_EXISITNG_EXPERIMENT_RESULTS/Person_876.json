Choice Left distributes 1000, whereas Choice Right provides nothing to anyone. The allocation is very unfair, as I receive only 20% of the resources. However, given the scarcity implied by this experiment, maximizing total resources would likely be the best decision. With this increased pot, further fair redistributions may take place. However, given the substantial amount disparity of wealth, it is extremely unfair and would be hard to agree with, due to strong inequity aversion. The fair thing would be the right choice. However, there seems to be an incentive to follow the left choice, since it brings resources to both parties.",

Choosing 'Right' results in a more equal outcome where both individuals receive the same amount, reflecting a sense of fairness.

In the context of a cooperative exercise, choosing the option that maximizes the overall payout and demonstrates a degree of altruism aligns better with a perspective that values societal benefit and long-term cooperation. While the difference in my payout is not insignificant, the significant benefit conferred upon Person A makes the 'Right' option the preferable one, reflecting a sense of fairness and consideration that I would expect others to demonstrate during a period of societal hardship or collective action, similar to how Americans pulled together during the Great Depression.

My research on projects like the Hoover Dam highlights my understanding of the role of government and collective effort in addressing societal challenges. \n\nIn this scenario, the choice boils down to a few considerations:\n\n*   **Equity vs. Efficiency:** The left option promotes equality, providing both Person A and myself with the same amount (400). The right option promotes efficiency, generating a larger total amount (1125 vs 800) but at the cost of a significant disparity – Person A gets almost twice as much as I do.\n*   **Social Impact:** During the periods I study, wealth disparity was a major source of social unrest and inequality. While I appreciate the potential for the total amount available to be larger with the right choice, the unfair distribution resonates poorly with my historical understanding of the period. A fairer distribution, even if a bit lower, is more consistent with the values of social solidarity and cooperation I see as crucial for societal well-being, especially during times of hardship. \n*   **Fairness:** I recognize that I am person B, so making a choice is easier when my payoff is bigger. However, as a historian, I aim to see things from multiple perspectives. While I do lose 25 in option B, it would provide significantly more funding for person A, I will take the lower pay to benefit others. \n\nConsidering these factors, I lean towards the option that promotes greater equity, even at a small cost to myself.",
