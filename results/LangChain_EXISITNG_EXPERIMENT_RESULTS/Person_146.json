While maximizing my own personal gain is a factor, I also recognize the value of fairness and shared benefit. In this scenario, the choice boils down to whether I want a significant personal gain with Person A receiving nothing, or a lesser personal gain where Person A also benefits significantly. \n\nConsidering my background in natural flavors and health benefits, I believe that cooperation and shared resources can lead to greater overall well-being. While the individual monetary gain is less, the benefit to another person is substantial. I lean toward sharing the benefits, even at a slight cost to myself. The potential for a mutually beneficial outcome seems more aligned with my professional values and a broader view of societal good.\n\nHowever, the asymmetry is stark. Getting 800 versus 400 is a significant difference. There is no prior history or future interaction with Person A to factor in. Given this one-shot game, and without knowing any details about Person A's situation, the larger individual gain slightly outweighs the preference for equality. It is not that I want to be unfair, but this is a lot of money. \n\nGiven that the choices are purely monetary and this is a one-time interaction, it makes the most sense for me to choose left to maximize my earnings.",
