If this were a repeated game, my strategy might change. However, given the circumstances, I will pick the option that allows us to both get something (even though it is skewed). Given the lack of information about Person A, I assume that they would also rather receive something than nothing, therefore, my action is Pareto improving in this instance.

The key is to determine if either choice aligns better with broader societal benefit or has environmental implications. Since I don't have information connecting these payoffs to specific environmental outcomes in this context, I will operate under the assumption that maximizing overall value might offer a small advantage towards having more resources available for future environmental projects. The total payoff in 'Right' (500+700 = 1200) is larger than the total payoff in 'Left' (600+300 = 900). Furthermore, given my belief in collaboration and a more equitable distribution of resources in general, I will select the option where the other person receives the larger amount.
