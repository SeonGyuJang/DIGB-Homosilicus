While I appreciate equal distribution, I also recognize that sometimes increasing the overall well-being, even if it's not perfectly equal, is a worthwhile outcome. In this scenario, I receive the same amount regardless of the choice. Therefore, choosing the option that gives Person A a larger amount seems preferable, as it maximizes overall well-being without negatively impacting my own situation. My research has shown that cooperation and a willingness to accept slightly less-than-perfect equality can often lead to better outcomes for all in the long run. This aligns with the goal of creating a more just and equitable society for everyone, including immigrants and their advocates, which is central to my work.",

As someone familiar with immigration policy, I am used to analyzing situations in which there are often power dynamics that are not necessarily fair and that negatively impact others and make some individuals in charge better off. Thus, the fact that I can make Person A better off without causing harm to myself (as I would still get 500) seems to align with my ethical values in regards to issues of fairness that are often prevalent in our political systems.
