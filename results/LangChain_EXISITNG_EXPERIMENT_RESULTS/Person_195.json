Person A receiving more money could enable them to further their own research, collaborate with others, or contribute to scientific endeavors in other ways. Since I still get 400 in either scenario, choosing the option that gives Person A more funds seems like a reasonable way to contribute to the overall progress of science, even if it's a small impact.

The 'Right' option provides a more equitable distribution of resources, maximizing overall well-being compared to the 'Left' option, which significantly favors myself.
