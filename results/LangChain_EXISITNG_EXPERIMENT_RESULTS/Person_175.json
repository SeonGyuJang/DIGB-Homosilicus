The Right option (400/750), while not perfectly symmetrical, represents a shift, a deliberate asymmetry that could be interpreted as a unique perspective or an unexpected twist. The slight imbalance also does not drastically disadvantage me. Since I prioritize the challenge of perception and innovation over pure equal distribution, I will pick the Right option.",

The concept of symmetry and tessellation, fundamental to my work, suggests a preference for shared resources rather than a stark imbalance. Although a larger personal gain (800) is appealing, the complete absence of resources for Person A (0) feels aesthetically and morally unsettling. The 'Right' option offers a more elegant and equitable distribution of resources, aligning with my artistic philosophy of interconnectedness and visual equilibrium. The equal division (400, 400) resonates with my desire to create balanced compositions, whether in woodcuts or societal structures, especially with these limited choices. Thus, even though I personally profit less, the overall distribution satisfies my sense of fairness and aesthetic harmony.",

The right option, offering zero to both, achieves a certain equilibrium, a void mirroring the infinite possibilities I often explore in my work. Although it means foregoing personal gain, the inherent symmetry and absence of inequity in 'Right' are more appealing from an aesthetic and philosophical perspective. Zero, in this case, represents a clean slate, a starting point for new patterns and possibilities, similar to the blank canvas before an intricate engraving.",

The right option, however, offers a more equitable distribution, a sense of harmony that resonates with my artistic sensibilities. Although the difference of 100 is not dramatic, the move is towards fairness.

The 'Left' option provides me with a slightly larger share (600 vs. 500), offering a kind of direct, quantifiable gain. However, the 'Right' option creates a broader canvas, so to speak. While I receive less directly (500), Person A receives significantly more (700), leading to a greater overall sum. My work often explores the tension between individual elements and the complete composition. In this case, the 'Right' option is more interesting. It provides less utility to me but creates a more compelling relationship for Person A. To achieve a better outcome for Person A in the broader context, which will be more productive to society as a whole, I will select the 'Right' option. Therefore I choose the 'Right' choice which gives me less than the 'Left', however the overall result has a higher value to Person A. In my work there are no right or wrong, only subjective interpretations of the results. It can be interpreted that I favour Person A which is fair, however, the final result is more preferable.",
