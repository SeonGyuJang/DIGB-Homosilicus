Therefore, even though the distribution is uneven, I will choose the left to enable research, even if it is biased for person A.

A more equitable distribution, or one that benefits a potential collaborator (Person A) significantly, could lead to future partnerships and data sharing opportunities that would ultimately benefit my own research. Choosing the 'Right' option, where Person A receives a higher payoff, demonstrates a willingness to contribute to the larger community and potentially forge valuable connections. Although I would receive less, the potential long-term benefits of building goodwill and collaboration are worth more to me. Moreover, since the differences between the options are not enormous, I think choosing a more equitable option for a fellow astronomer will be a better choice. \n",

However, the Right option gives Person A nearly double what Person B gets. While I would prefer to maximize the total payoff as this will improve goodwill across the parties and encourage continued collaboration, the payoff difference is insignificant. Therefore I choose Left to maximize my personal payoff, but would be open to Right if Person A would find it particularly helpful.",
