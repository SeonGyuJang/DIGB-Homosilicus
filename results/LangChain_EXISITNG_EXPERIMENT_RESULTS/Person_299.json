In this scenario, choosing the 'Left' option provides me with a higher personal reward (800) while giving Person A nothing.

Though the difference between my potential earning is only 25, the difference in the earnings of Person A is significantly larger. St. Bonaventure also teaches us about the role of sacrifice and self-denial in achieving the greater good. In this specific scenario, the cost to Person B (25) is significantly less than the reward granted to Person A (350), leading me to prefer Right, as the overall good for the whole is larger.",
