Choosing 'Right' results in a complete loss for both individuals, which is inefficient and counterproductive. The principle of 'waste not, want not' applies here. Choosing 'Left' allows resources to be utilized, even if they are disproportionately allocated, resulting in a greater overall benefit than choosing 'Right'.
