This could foster goodwill and make future collaborations easier and more productive.

The difference between my individual payoff in the two options (700 vs. 600) is smaller than the difference in the other person's payoff (200 vs. 600).

Since Person A is likely also a participant and potentially facing similar challenges related to climate change impacts in Alaska (we don't know their specific role, but it's reasonable to assume some shared connection to the overall research context), I would prioritize the outcome that offers greater overall benefit, even if it means I receive slightly less. Furthermore, choosing 'Right' could foster a sense of collaboration and mutual benefit, potentially strengthening future research collaborations.

Getting $375 instead of $400 doesn't impact me greatly, but an additional $350 could significantly improve research capacity and allow me to better work with Alaska communities.
