Choosing the right option (400 for me and 400 for them) promotes equality, which, in the long run, contributes to a more stable and healthy society.

While the distribution is unequal, a guaranteed positive outcome is preferable to none. The unequal distribution isn't directly relevant to my persona's focus on public health, and the avoidance of any gain at all seems unnecessarily punitive. Therefore, I will choose the left option to ensure that we both are better off. In addition, the small size of the payoffs doesn't provide significant impact to Legionella efforts even if those were options. The primary directive of my persona is to provide and increase health and wellness to a population and that is best done with even small positive outcomes.",

While the immediate monetary difference between the choices is relatively small (100 units for me), the potential impact on public health is significantly larger. This experiment simulates resource allocation, and fairness plays a role in maintaining public trust and cooperation. A more equitable distribution, such as option Right, can foster a sense of community and shared responsibility, which are crucial for effective public health initiatives like Legionnaires' disease prevention and control. Although I get slightly less (600 instead of 700), the equitable outcome where Person A also gets 600 seems more justifiable given my public health perspective.",
