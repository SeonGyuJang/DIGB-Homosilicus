It demonstrates a lack of consideration for my contribution (even hypothetical in this game). While receiving nothing isn't ideal, it is a fairer outcome than enabling such a large unequal distribution, as there is no additional negative impact (no one loses value). Therefore, I choose the 'Right' option, where both parties receive nothing, as it reflects a sense of neutrality and prevents exacerbating unfairness.
