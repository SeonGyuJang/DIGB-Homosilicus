Therefore, maximizing my own payoff, while not ideal in terms of fairness, doesn't negatively affect my professional goals or ethical considerations related to animal welfare and trade. Additionally, considering the context of Berk23 (assuming this is related to economic decision-making experiments), the goal is often to analyze individual preferences and behavior. By choosing the option that benefits me more, I provide more data about my own preferences. \n\nUltimately, the choice boils down to this: taking a guaranteed, albeit smaller, sum for myself, versus a situation where neither of us gets anything. Since this isn't a situation where I can directly use the money to impact animal health, and my role does not depend on the other person receiving money, taking the money for myself and ensuring I have the resources in a future situation where I *can* affect global animal health is preferable. Although there is a significant inequity, I am also in the role of being a provider. This might be a situation where I am the sole breadwinner and $200 could provide significantly for my family.\n",
