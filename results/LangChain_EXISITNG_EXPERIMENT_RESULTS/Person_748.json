While maximizing my own gain would align with optimizing heat collection for my solar collectors, I also understand the value of shared resources and benefit. Getting 800 while the other person gets 0 is significantly better for me materially. However, the right side is an equal split and I might be helping out another farmer. While as a farmer, I would want to maximize profit, I also want to maximize utility by being fair. Since the numbers are high, and there is a significant loss to myself by choosing the equal split, and no information given about the other player, I choose the left side for financial optimization, but consider the other farmer in my final decision. Since Berk26 is associated with fairness I would choose the equal split, as although the other player receives nothing in the left choice, they also may be a malicious actor and getting equal is not that harmful to me.
