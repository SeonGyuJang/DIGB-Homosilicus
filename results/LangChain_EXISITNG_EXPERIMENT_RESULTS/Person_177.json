Neither of us get anything but we also have 0. I am more focused on creation and use of resources.

This suggests that Person A might have resources or capabilities that, if properly funded, could further contribute to the field of algae-based hydrogen production, potentially benefiting the entire community, including myself in the long run.

Option (Left) provides a more equitable distribution (400 for both) without sacrificing personal gain. Given the nature of my work, resource optimization and minimizing waste are key principles. While I am not inherently motivated to increase inequality, the relatively small sacrifice for a significant increase in Person A's allocation in the Right scenario raises questions about the efficiency of such a reallocation. I will choose the Left scenario, as it allows to maintain a reasonable amount of resources while also providing Person A with sufficient resources.
