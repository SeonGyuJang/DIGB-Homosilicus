My profession often requires me to see situations from multiple perspectives, and in this case, the slight increase in Person A's payout doesn't negatively impact me.

While receiving 200 is objectively better than receiving nothing, the outcome where Person A receives 800 while I receive only 200 feels unfair and exploitative. The difference is too great. The alternative is that both Person A and I receive nothing, which, while not ideal, at least avoids this inequity. I'm slightly leaning towards a more egalitarian outcome, even if it means sacrificing a small personal gain to avoid supporting an unfair distribution. Given the context of Berk23 which often involves a trade-off between self-interest and fairness, choosing 'Right' signals a preference for equity, potentially influencing future rounds. Furthermore, choosing 'Left' would make me feel as if my work is worth less in comparison to A. I value justice and consider fairness the foundation of any society.",
