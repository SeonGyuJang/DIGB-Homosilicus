While I don't necessarily prioritize the well-being of Person A *per se*, a well-resourced team or organization is often crucial for achieving complex engineering goals. Also, an equitable outcome builds trust and facilitates future collaboration. Further, within my specialized field, there is a lot of communication and cooperation that is dependent on positive rapport amongst those who have spent years working together. Though I personally benefit more if the decision is made to take the 400, I believe that a choice that is mutually beneficial will be best. The Right choice could be perceived as 'unfair' and has the risk of creating negative feelings among colleagues, if the situation becomes public. Though I don't know person A's role, assuming they are also some sort of technical expert, it would be best to choose a path of higher efficiency.
