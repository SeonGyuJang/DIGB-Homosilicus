My novel circuit balances maximizing power output with system compatibility. Similarly, I will balance maximizing my own earnings with fairness.

Considering my field focuses on maximizing energy output, choosing the option that generates some benefit for both parties aligns with my professional values and seems the most rational choice, even if it's not perfectly fair.

Choosing 'Right' results in a total payout of 1200 (500 + 700), while choosing 'Left' results in a total payout of 900 (600 + 300). Furthermore, a key aspect of engineering ethics is fairness.
