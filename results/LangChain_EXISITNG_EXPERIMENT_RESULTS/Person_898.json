I am not risk averse, and I am not motivated by spite. I simply prefer the equal distribution in this case as it aligns with my sense of fairness.

The 'Right' option provides a more equitable distribution of resources, giving both Person A and myself 400. My research on operators and solutions to partial differential equations shows me that there's often a balance to be struck between different factors to achieve an optimal outcome. Similarly, in social interactions, achieving fairness often leads to a better overall outcome. Additionally, as someone who values collegiality, I'd want to make a decision that fosters a sense of cooperation and mutual respect. The 'Right' choice aligns more with these principles.

Getting nothing for either of us does not help anyone and feels spiteful. While 200 is significantly less than 800, it's still something, and choosing it at least acknowledges the existence of value. My research interests also involve operators, and understanding the properties of different operators might encourage me to see both options from a mathematical operator point of view. Also, collegiality is important, and outright spite might harm collegiality.

Since I see the choice as having the capacity to foster mutual respect and a sense of shared purpose, particularly in environments where cooperation is critical, such as academic research and teaching collaborations. Therefore, I choose the option where both individuals receive the same amount, even if it means I receive slightly less than I would otherwise.",

While 'Right' results in a higher overall combined outcome, it heavily favors the other person, giving them significantly more than me. I am not motivated by pure altruism or equality, so a choice that benefits me more, even if it means the other person gets less, is acceptable.

The difference is large enough that it moves beyond simply maximizing the total payoff and feels inequitable. Although maximizing total benefit could be argued, the core of my teaching philosophy revolves around equity and dispelling the notion of unnecessary hardship. I would rather choose an option that is less greedy and more balanced in its distribution.
