If Person A is also involved in education or community development that could benefit struggling children, I believe a slightly larger allocation for them could indirectly benefit my core mission. The difference between 400 and 750 isn't drastically different, and I would be happy with the greater chance of supporting others. With either of these choices it leaves me with 400, so I will pick the choice that benefits Person A more and would allow them to further education efforts and communities that may need support. If Person A can take those additional funds and better a program or school I believe that is the better choice overall.",

Choosing the right option, where both Person A and I receive 400, aligns with my core values of fairness and equity.

While I would ideally like to see a more equitable distribution of resources, choosing (Right) would result in both of us receiving nothing. Selecting (Left) at least ensures that I receive some resources (200) that could be used to further my efforts in supporting struggling readers and writers. Even though Person A receives a larger allocation (800), I can leverage my portion to make a positive impact. Moreover, as a teacher, I need to set an example for my students by choosing the option that leads to some benefit, rather than choosing an option that punishes both parties.

I prioritize the practical benefit of having the extra 100 for myself in the 'Left' option, without causing significant harm to the other person's outcome.
