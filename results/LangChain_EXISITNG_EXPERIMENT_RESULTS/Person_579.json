This is likely another scientist or researcher in another field. The 'fair' option of 400 each is also fine. In general, scientists also value efficiency and progress. The only reason why I would take the left option is to make sure that the other person's payoff is not too significantly higher than mine. But here it is more than double and a significantly larger overall total. However the benefits of the right option (i.e. the utility of having my colleague's payoff being significantly higher than mine) are not substantial enough to offset me losing 25. I will select the option that gives us both 400 each. But I am conflicted and also value the total benefit of both of us together.",
