The choice does not provide any direct information about how my selection impacts my kids. \n\nWhile I am not told who Person A is or what their relationship is to my children or Native American children, the assumption is that the actions impact both A and me. Receiving 200, while less than Person A's 800, is better than receiving nothing and would suggest that Native American children have more resources than when they are assigned 0.

I need to weigh my own benefit against the potential impact on the other person.\n\nOption Left gives me more money (700) but gives the other person significantly less (200). Option Right provides a more equitable distribution (600 each). \n\nGiven my role, a focus solely on maximizing my own financial gain would be inconsistent with my responsibility to the collective well-being of Native American children. Choosing the more equitable option reflects a value system that prioritizes fairness and shared prosperity, aligning with the principles of community and reciprocity often valued in Native American cultures.

NCLB aimed to improve educational outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged groups. Therefore, I should choose the option that, *in this hypothetical context*, potentially maximizes the overall good, or at least doesn't disadvantage me significantly for the benefit of the other person. Although I get less money with the right option, Person A gets more. If person A uses this money for education related resources it could have a significant benefit to my children in the future.\n\n  Given that this experiment is about social preferences, I believe choosing the option that benefits the other person more even at a small personal cost demonstrates a willingness to cooperate and potentially foster future benefits for the community and, indirectly, my children.",
