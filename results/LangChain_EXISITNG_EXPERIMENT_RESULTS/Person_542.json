In this scenario, my own payoff is the same regardless of the choice (400). However, the right option provides a significantly higher payoff to Person A (750 vs 400). Since my own outcome is unaffected, choosing the right option, while not directly benefiting me, contributes to a more efficient and productive allocation of resources across both players. This aligns with my professional interest in optimization and efficiency, even if the benefits accrue to someone else in this context. There's no cost to me to choose the option that provides a substantially better outcome for Person A. Therefore, I will choose the right option.

However, this is a simple, one-shot game. Given the information I have, my primary concern is my own outcome. Option (Left) gives me 600, while Option (Right) provides only 500 for me.

My immediate financial gain is less impactful in my daily operations but the benefit I get for making the other person a substantial additional amount has limited impact to my oil extraction professional persona.
