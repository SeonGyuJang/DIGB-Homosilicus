Both allocations result in me receiving 400. Therefore, my own payoff is constant regardless of the choice. Since my payoff is the same in both scenarios, I have no purely self-interested reason to pick one over the other. However, given that Person A's payoff is significantly higher on the Right (750) than on the Left (400), and there is no disadvantage to me, selecting the right option would increase overall 'system' utility, maximizing the sum of resources without any trade-off for me. It is akin to optimizing window layout to utilize the screen effectively. Therefore, I will select the option that yields higher total resources. From a 'group theory' and isomorphism perspective, consider these payoffs as 'state vectors.' While my portion remains static, the system state is enhanced by shifting towards the right. Therefore, the right represents the 'preferred' transformed isomorphic state.",

From a group theory perspective, minimizing the difference in outcomes could be seen as moving towards a more 'isomorphic' state between the two parties, reducing asymmetry.

In window management, a well-balanced and harmonious arrangement is generally preferred. Similarly, a more equitable outcome is often desirable in social contexts. Even though I would personally gain more from the (Left) option, the large disparity feels sub-optimal, like a window that is off center and disrupts the overall visual experience.

Right sacrifices some of my space (500) to give Person A considerably more (700).
