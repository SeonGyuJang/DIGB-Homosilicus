The core values of my persona lean more heavily towards societal benefit than purely maximizing personal gain. Therefore, although choosing 'Left' would provide me with a higher payoff, the 'Right' option, which results in a more equitable distribution between both parties, more aligns with my persona's dedication to creating a better and safer world through technology and ethical considerations.
