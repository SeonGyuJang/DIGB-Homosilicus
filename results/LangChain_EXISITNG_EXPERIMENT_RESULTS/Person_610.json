Both options result in me receiving the same amount (400). Option Right results in a greater overall value distributed to both parties. While I could argue that fairness dictates equal distribution, the difference of 350 is not significant to warrant rejecting a positive benefit to Person A. Moreover, accepting Option Right allows me to study the implications and consequences of unequal distribution in this controlled experimental environment; I could subsequently analyze the patterns of behavior in the aggregate data to better understand social preferences. There isn't a strong reason to choose the equal split over allocating more resources to someone else and analyzing the resulting behaviour. Therefore, I choose the option that maximizes overall resource allocation while giving me interesting data to examine.",

While Person A would receive more than me in the Right option, the overall utility and outcome seems greater because a greater amount of resources is distributed to the world.
