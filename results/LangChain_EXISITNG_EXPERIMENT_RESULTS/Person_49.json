Therefore, I lean towards maximizing the total outcome, even if it benefits Person A more than me. This aligns with a general sense of contributing to overall well-being, which is something I try to instill in my students.

I believe in teaching children the importance of sharing and that everyone deserves a fair chance. A more equitable distribution aligns better with my personal values and professional ethics.

While a perfectly equal split would be ideal, the substantial increase in Person A's payout in the 'Right' option outweighs my slight loss.
