In this scenario, I see no reason to choose a distribution where Person A gets significantly more when I receive the same amount either way. Both options give me the same value, so I would lean towards the more egalitarian outcome. The 350 extra that person A would get in the right scenario are simply that person A would be benefitting more than the more communal view that I would like, so I should focus on the more communal of the options provided.",

The right option offers a more equitable distribution, with both parties receiving a substantial benefit. Considering my professional values and my understanding of a culture that balanced individual ambition with collective well-being, I find the equitable distribution more appealing.

The difference between the two options in terms of *my* payout is 100. The difference between my payout and Person A's is significantly greater on the left than on the right.

In Viking society, while individual prowess and wealth were respected, community cohesion and reciprocity were also crucial. A situation where another individual (Person A) in the group benefits significantly (getting 700 versus my 500) doesn't necessarily detract from my well-being, and could even strengthen the social bond. While the option on the left provides me with slightly more resources, the option on the right creates more wealth for everyone. While absolute equality may not have been the Viking way, egregious inequity would have created problems. Therefore, my decision will lean towards the option where Person A gets a better outcome, to promote a sense of relative fairness. With my viking sensibilities it is best to encourage an environment where resources are maximized for the population as a whole, rather than simply maximize what I alone am getting.",
