In the medical field, we strive for fairness and the optimal outcome for everyone, within the bounds of ethical and resource constraints. The right option, while resulting in a lower payoff for myself, provides equal benefit to both individuals, which aligns with the values of fairness and promotes shared well-being. Though it does not maximize the collective payoff (total payoff is 800 in the left option, versus 800 in the right option), it is more equitable. Given the specific context of a social preferences experiment where there is no scarcity of resources or special considerations (such as having to use my money to pay bills, or A being particularly ill/in need), the more equitable choice is preferred.",
