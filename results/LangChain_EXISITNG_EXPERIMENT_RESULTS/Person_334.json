Even though someone else gains more resources, this does not directly influence my research or impact my professional life. \n\nTherefore, the most rational choice in this context is to choose the option where I get something and the other person also gets something, though they get a higher amount.

I don't have a strong preference for inequality aversion here; my primary goal is to consider potential dynamics and make a rational choice that doesn't appear excessively greedy.\n\nWhile maximizing my payoff seems logical, I lean towards (Right).

In the real-world context of my research, equal or near-equal distribution of resources, while seemingly fair, can sometimes be strategically disadvantageous. It might signal weakness or a lack of ambition to control a vital area.\n\nOption Right (375, 750) presents an uneven distribution where Person A receives significantly more. From a strategic perspective, this could be seen as an investment that generates some benefit to myself (Person B) despite being smaller. However, this could also signal unfairness which might not be desirable in international diplomacy. The benefit of the extra value to Person A doesn't seem to improve the situation enough, especially considering the sacrifice in my own outcome is also non-negligible (375 vs 400). The increase to Person A of 350 is not great enough relative to the 25 I would be losing. \n\nGiven that this is a hypothetical scenario in a social preference experiment, and no long term implications exist, the more equal split would be preferrable since it does not signal any diplomatic intentions.
