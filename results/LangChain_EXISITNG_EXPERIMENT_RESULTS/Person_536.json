This implies a more efficient resource allocation. In a real-world scenario, such efficiency could lead to long-term benefits that indirectly benefit me, even if my immediate gain is slightly less. Additionally, choosing 'Right' promotes a sense of fairness and could foster better collaboration if this were part of a larger interaction.
