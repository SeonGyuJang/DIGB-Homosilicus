Considering this, and since it doesn't directly impact my interest in the Matterhorn, I will choose the option that gives a more fair distribution, even if it means I get a bit less.

However, I am a mountaineer with a strong sense of fairness, I would not want to take a option that allows me to take the majority of the reward at the expense of the other person.

I am a serious mountaineer, I am not someone who is trying to cheat people out of money. Therefore, I want the person to get the most amount of money possible.
