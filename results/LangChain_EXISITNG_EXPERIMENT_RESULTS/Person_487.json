Choosing the left option provides both Person A and myself with some value, even if it's unequally distributed. The right option results in a negative outcome for both.

This feels unfair and goes against my principles of promoting positive relationships and addressing issues constructively. Choosing the option where I get 500 and the other person gets 700 demonstrates a willingness to prioritize fairness and consider the well-being of others. It also models the kind of empathy and consideration I try to instill in my students. Although I would personally prefer 600 for myself, the greater overall good and the demonstration of fairness outweigh the personal gain of 100.
