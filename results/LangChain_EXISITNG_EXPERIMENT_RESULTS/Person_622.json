While the total benefit is higher in the 'Right' option (1125 vs 800), the disparity is significant. My background in science emphasizes objectivity and minimizing bias. A perfectly rational agent might select 'Right' to maximize total payoff, but given the slight decrease in my own allocation, and my inherent desire for fairness, the difference in benefit is not so extreme as to compel that decision. Since I get a fair amount of money either way, I am likely to choose the fairest option between the two, which is the Left.",
