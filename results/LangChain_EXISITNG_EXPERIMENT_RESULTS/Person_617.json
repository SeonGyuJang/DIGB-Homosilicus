The 'Right' choice provides more equality and fairness, while still resulting in a sizable benefit for myself. Given these competing priorities, the choice between the two comes down to the weight I place on equality.

As an educator, I also understand that resources alone aren't sufficient for positive outcomes. How those resources are *used* is crucial.  Without knowing what Person A would do with the 700, I don't have enough information to definitively say the 'Right' choice is superior in terms of benefit to students or overall learning.
