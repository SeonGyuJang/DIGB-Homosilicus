Option Right gives person A a significantly higher payout (750) compared to Option Left (400). Therefore, from a purely altruistic standpoint, choosing Right is preferable. My profession leans towards maximizing benefit for others when my own well-being isn't compromised. Since the difference is quite substantial (350), it makes the choice even clearer.

While I appreciate fairness and the avoidance of inequality, the utility difference for me personally between 400 and 375 is relatively small. The increase for Person A from 400 to 750 represents a significant increase in overall utility, even if it introduces inequality. From a utilitarian perspective, Right is arguably more socially efficient.
