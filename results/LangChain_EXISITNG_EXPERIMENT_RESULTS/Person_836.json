Option (Right) offers a more equitable distribution, where both parties receive the same amount. While a slight increase in my own payoff might seem appealing, the principle of fairness weighs heavily on my decision-making. Option (Right) aligns better with ethical considerations that I typically face as a healthcare professional, such as promoting well-being for all rather than prioritizing my own benefits when faced with minimal personal gain.\n\nFurthermore, the difference in monetary value between the two options for me is relatively small (100 units).
