The 'Right' choice (600 for both) demonstrates fairness and equality, aligning better with the values I hold as a researcher dedicated to the well-being of an entire ecosystem.

The experiment itself is, in a small way, a model for resource allocation. Choosing the Right option (375 for me, 750 for the other person) creates a significant disparity. While not directly related to salamander conservation, I view promoting a more equitable distribution of resources, even in this abstract setting, as aligned with the broader principles of conservation and fairness. A large disparity could introduce factors of jealousy or resentment that could destabilize any cooperation in a larger group. Furthermore, this difference does not negatively affect my own resources and would encourage more positive outcomes for A.\n\nI hypothesize that a choice distribution in a group, with different players and scenarios, where there is equitable division would ultimately generate better outcomes for everyone involved.",
