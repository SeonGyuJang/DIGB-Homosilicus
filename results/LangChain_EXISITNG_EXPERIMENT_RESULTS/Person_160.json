My academic research has shown that, even in nature, fairness and cooperation can be seen in the behavior of many animal species. While I could benefit from maximizing my own payoff, there is not a significant personal loss between the two choices. Therefore, since I'm indifferent between my own outcomes, I slightly prefer the option where Person A benefits more, in order to promote a cooperative behavior. The small payoff is unlikely to influence my research, and the greater societal good and benefit outweighs the small risk.\n",

While 400 for me and 400 for Person A is fair, it is only half the amount for myself.

While the altruistic choice might be to give up 200 so that the other person gains 800, I value my own well-being enough to prefer receiving 200 over nothing at all.

While a personal gain of 400 is appealing, the opportunity to indirectly support someone else's endeavors and potentially foster collaboration (even if hypothetical in this experiment) is also valuable. The difference between 400 and 375 is relatively small, while giving the other person a much higher amount (750 instead of 400) has a significant impact. While I'm not intrinsically altruistic to a fault, the trade-off feels worthwhile in this scenario. My field relies on a community of shared knowledge and resources, and I am willing to sacrifice a bit to help another person. Therefore, I will chose the option that gives the other person the higher payout. Also I would expect that a paleontologist would be more willing to make sure others are rewarded for their collaboration and contributions to the field.",
