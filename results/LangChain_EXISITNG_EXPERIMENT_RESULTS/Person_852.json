Both options provide me with the same amount (400), but the Right option significantly increases the payout for Person A (750 compared to 400).

The right option, while giving me less (400), provides Person A with an equal share (400). This aligns with my value of fairness and a more equitable distribution of resources.

The 'Left' option presents a highly unequal distribution, with Person A receiving significantly more. While I could potentially benefit from a smaller amount (200), the extreme disparity makes me uncomfortable. The 'Right' option, while yielding nothing for either person, avoids perpetuating this inequality. Given my focus on long-term well-being and fair practices, I lean towards the 'Right' option, even though it means foregoing a small financial benefit. However, the question does not explicitly say what Person A does, if Person A is also promoting unhealthy practices that endanger patients, I will rather get zero than getting 200 with Person A getting 800 for unethical behaviors. Given the limited context and focusing on the pure outcomes, the disparity makes the right option the better, if somewhat spiteful, choice.",
