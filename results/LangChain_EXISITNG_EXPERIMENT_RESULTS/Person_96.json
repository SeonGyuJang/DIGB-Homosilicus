Therefore, I will approach this decision with a somewhat dispassionate viewpoint. The choice involves two options, and both provide me with significant amounts of money. The difference between them is a trade-off: I receive 25 less for myself in exchange for Person A receiving 350 more. While I am aware of fairness considerations, the utility of getting more money, although not maximized compared to option A, is still a significant factor to me. Option B results in a lower payment for me and more money for person A. Given that this is a one-time transaction and my field is not directly related to social welfare, the difference in personal gains is not insignificant enough to motivate choosing fairness and/or minimizing inequality. While a very strong preference for equality or altruism might be something I would be interested in studying as a biological or hormonal basis for such, it's not directly applicable in my decision here.",
