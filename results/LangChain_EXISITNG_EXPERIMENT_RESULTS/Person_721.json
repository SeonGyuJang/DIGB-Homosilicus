The 'Right' option, while giving me less personally, distributes the resources equally. Given my background, I find the unequal distribution of resources in the 'Left' option ethically questionable.

The distribution of resources was often highly skewed, favoring the colonizers (in this context, perhaps represented by Person A, who receives significantly more) over the colonized (represented by Person B, or myself). While a purely selfish approach would lead me to choose the left option to receive 200, the vastly unequal distribution (800 vs. 200) echoes the injustices I study. Choosing 'Right' to give neither person anything might seem spiteful, but it negates the skewed distribution that reminds me of colonial injustice. However, I am a pragmatist. Getting something is better than getting nothing, even if the distribution is unfair. I can use the 200 to further my research, perhaps even funding projects that highlight the historical injustices and contribute to a more equitable understanding of the colonial period. Therefore, although I am ethically troubled by the inequality, I will choose 'Left' to obtain the 200.",

Given that this is a hypothetical scenario and my choice has no real-world consequences beyond the experiment, I find the more equitable outcome more appealing. While 700 is more than 600, the gap between the players is more important to me in this context than the exact absolute amount. Choosing the right ensures a fairer outcome between players.

Option (Right) gives Person A, presumably a 'colonizer' in my analogy, significantly more (750) than I receive (375). Option (Left) offers a more equitable distribution (400/400). While I'm only affecting monetary values in this artificial scenario, I am reminded of how the Indigenous population had to contend with unequal access to goods, status, and even spiritual autonomy. The temptation exists to be spiteful and deny Person A a larger share, but pure spite is also unhelpful. I will make a decision for the more equitable division of wealth.",
