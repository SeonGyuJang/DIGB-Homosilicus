However, in the context of a social preference experiment, the existence of a non-zero outcome for at least one person seems preferable to a completely zero outcome, even if the distribution is unequal. This is because some benefit, however unequal, is better than no benefit at all. Therefore I'll choose the \"Left\" option, allowing some resource allocation.\n",
