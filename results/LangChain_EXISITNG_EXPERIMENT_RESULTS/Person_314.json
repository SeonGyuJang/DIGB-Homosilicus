The prompt doesn't specify any prior relationship or context that would justify prioritizing minimizing Person A's gain. Both options give me (Person B) the same amount of money, 400. Given that I have no selfish reason to choose one over the other, I should choose the option that maximizes the overall benefit, which is the 'Right' choice, where Person A gets 750. This embodies a principle of maximizing overall welfare and avoids being driven by envy or spite. This choice also aligns with the persona's values of focusing on positive outcomes and educational effectiveness, as selecting the option that provides a larger benefit to someone else doesn't negatively impact me and can be seen as a prosocial decision.",

The 'Right' option, while resulting in no payout for either person, prevents a large disparity. Given our focus on fairness and the potential for the large disparity in the 'Left' option to introduce unintended consequences or biases in a learning context (e.g., perceived inequity impacting motivation), the more conservative and fair choice is preferred. Furthermore, as educators, we are more concerned about the overall system and its equitable impact rather than individual gains. Preventing a large disparity aligns better with our ethos. Finally, although we are keen on evaluating the impact of learning tools, this specific experimental scenario doesn't relate directly to assessing Vizi's efficacy. Thus, we select the option that minimizes inequity.",

Although as educators we may have some intrinsic altruistic motivation, the relatively small impact from each of these decisions mean that the small amount of equity afforded through the 'left' option is better than maximizing the income of Person A through the right option.
