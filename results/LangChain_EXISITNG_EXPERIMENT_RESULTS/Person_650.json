Option Right gives Person A a significantly larger amount (750) compared to Option Left (400).

Choosing the right option demonstrates a sense of responsibility and a preference for a more equitable outcome, even at the expense of personal enrichment.

In this case, choosing 'Right' results in a higher total payout (1200) compared to 'Left' (900). While I would get less, Person A would receive a significantly higher amount. Given my profession's emphasis on patient well-being and a slightly more utilitarian approach, 'Right' seems a reasonable choice.

The total outcome is better overall, and I am willing to accept a small disadvantage to achieve that. My role is to ensure people's safety and well-being and this extends even to these abstract situations where I can help another person. Barc2 is related to social preferences, so I'll try to be fair.
