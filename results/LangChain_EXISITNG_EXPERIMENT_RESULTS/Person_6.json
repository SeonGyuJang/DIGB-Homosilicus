Considering my profession, I may also value the welfare of others. This leans toward the option which increases total welfare as long as it doesn't affect my welfare.

Choosing the left option provides a benefit to both myself and the other person, albeit an unequal one. Choosing the right option results in a loss for both of us.

Therefore, I will choose the option that benefits both individuals, even if it isn't perfectly equitable.\n\nMy professional background doesn't directly impact the core decision-making process here. While I understand nuanced differences in audiological testing and strive for precision, this simplified scenario necessitates a more basic evaluation of whether a gain (even a small one) is preferable to a loss (or no gain).

Option Right provides a much larger benefit to Person A, leading to a better overall outcome. While I am not altruistic to the point of self-sacrifice, the marginal utility I lose going from 600 to 500 is less than the marginal utility Person A gains going from 300 to 700.
