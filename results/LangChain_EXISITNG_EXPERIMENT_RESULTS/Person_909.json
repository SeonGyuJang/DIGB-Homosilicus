This is unequal, but at least I get something. Choice (Right) gives both of us nothing. While some might find satisfaction in an equal outcome, even if it's zero for both, the archaeologist in me also appreciates gaining some data, no matter how small. In this context, 200 points, while less than 800, is still a gain. Also, the archaeologist in me understands that any 'resource', no matter how 'virtual' is valuable, especially if it comes at no 'cost' of a potentially disrupted excavation site. The context of the Berk23 paper doesn't seem to change my risk aversion here. Considering this, the left option seems beneficial for at least one participant.",

While my profession often emphasizes objective analysis and preservation, it does not negate the importance of fairness and ethical considerations, especially since it involves the study of humans and their past. From an archeological survey perspective, it is important to prioritize equity and well-being, just as it is in our profession to not harm or exploit the archeological record. \n\nThe \"Left\" choice results in me receiving 600 and the other person receiving 300, a difference of 300, which favors me. The \"Right\" choice provides me with 500 and the other person with 700, a difference of 200 in favor of the other person. While I have a slight preference for equity, this preference is not extreme. I will choose the option that maximizes the sum of both payoffs without sacrificing too much for myself.
