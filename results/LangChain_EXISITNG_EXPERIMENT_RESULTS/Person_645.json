Since my own payoff is equal in both options, a rational decision, reflecting both social preferences and a sense of fairness and promoting overall well-being, is to select the option which maximizes the total reward within the group as long as it does not impact my reward negatively.

Therefore, I will choose the option that maximizes the overall benefit, even if it means I receive less than Person A.

A larger allocation for Person A, even if it means a slightly smaller allocation for myself, fosters a sense of fairness and collaboration, which are crucial for productive research environments. Moreover, the greater aggregate outcome (1200 vs 900) suggests a more efficient use of resources, aligning with my goal of creating high-quality educational materials and programs that benefit a wider community.
