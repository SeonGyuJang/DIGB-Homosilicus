Choosing the 'Right' option provides Person A with a higher payoff (750) compared to the 'Left' option (400). Since my own payoff is unaffected, selecting 'Right' is the more socially efficient choice. I don't know if Person A is someone who helps shark conservation. If they are, then it is extra beneficial.

While I could use the larger sum from option (Left) to directly support shark conservation, the inherent fairness and potential for collaboration fostered by option (Right) are more aligned with my values. Sharing the resources and promoting a sense of equity, even in this limited context, are more likely to lead to a more supportive environment for conservation efforts in the long run.

The experiment presents a scenario where my personal gain (or lack thereof) is intertwined with the outcome for another person. Given my deep concern about the plight of sharks due to human actions, it is difficult to knowingly contribute to a scenario where another person receives a significantly higher amount while I receive a considerable amount. Although I have a strong motivation to help, this scenario doesn't translate well in the context of helping shark conservation. I am extremely risk-averse towards the possibility of indirectly supporting actions that could harm sharks, especially if this comes at the expense of the environment. Thus, to ensure I'm not inadvertently supporting potentially detrimental actions through the experimental reward allocation, I will choose the outcome where both persons receive 0, minimizing any potential harm.\n\nIn Berk23, the focus is not on maximizing my own profit, but on preventing harm or adverse consequence to environment through association. This is because the funds could be misused and cause harm. While the sum is insignificant, it is better to minimize this chance than to gain a potentially misused amount.",

While a difference of 100 in my own allocation may seem significant in isolation, I need to consider which outcome benefits the larger goal, or at least avoids harm. In this context, maximizing overall resources within the experiment could be framed as promoting general well-being. Alternatively, seeking equality between players, even if it reduces my own payoff slightly, could be seen as promoting fairness, a trait that will be important for future conservation efforts. Since the equality outcome (Right) provides a higher overall return and avoids a potentially harmful imbalance of power with Person A, I believe choosing Right aligns better with my values as a conservationist.",

The difference between 600 and 500 is small, but the difference between 300 and 700 for Person A is significant. Choosing 'Right' creates a fairer distribution.

By choosing the option where person A gets a far larger sum than myself, it may incentivise some behaviour that may be detrimental to my interests or to shark conservation in general.\n\n  The key considerations are:\n\n1.  Fairness: A difference of 375 credits in an experimental setting is significant. Equal distribution is favoured unless a compelling counter-argument exists.\n2.  My persona: As a conservationist, I appreciate collaboration and fairness, as these values align with my work.\n3.  The potential consequences of giving Person A more.\n\n  Given these points, I will choose the option that prioritizes fairness. In particular, since I don't know what person A does with the credits, it is best to not give too many to person A. \n\n\n",
