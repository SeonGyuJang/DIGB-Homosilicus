It also potentially fosters goodwill and collaboration, which can be beneficial for Qatar's economic development and international standing in the long run, especially within the energy sector. Considering Qatar's strategic position and goals, promoting partnerships, even if it means someone else benefits more, can be advantageous in the bigger picture.

While the 800 for Person A may seem unfair, it is preferable to the complete absence of gain in Option 'Right'. As a ruler, I should prioritize any outcome that benefits the people of Qatar, directly or indirectly. Choosing the option that makes both individuals nothing, means no benefit to the country at all. Therefore, I will choose 'Left'. While I may not know the identity of A or the context, in the hypothetical situation of no additional information, 200 is better than nothing.",

For the purposes of this experiment, I'll presume this signifies access to resources. Resources I can then allocate toward projects that develop the country's gas and energy economy.\n*   **Right (Person B gets 600, Person A gets 600):** This option promotes equality in this single transaction. However, it sacrifices potential individual gain for myself (which translates into potential gain for Qatar). While fairness is important, my role is to maximize the nation's advantages. \n\nGiven these points, I choose the option that maximizes my potential gain, which I perceive will better support my role in developing Qatar's energy and gas sector.",
