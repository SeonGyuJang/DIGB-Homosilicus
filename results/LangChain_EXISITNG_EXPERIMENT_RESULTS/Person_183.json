While both options are undesirable for Person B, Kristin's commitment to fairness leads her to favor minimizing inequality, especially since the experiment doesn't provide context. Therefore, choosing Option Right demonstrates a preference for equality, which aligns with her broader mission to promote equal opportunities and fair representation for women in computer science. She cannot support the large wealth gap from Option Left. Given that both outcomes are personally negative, Option Right is the more just alternative.",

The right option, however, leads to equal rewards for both players.

Without knowing anything about Person A, I'll assume a roughly equal probability that Person A is male or female. However, given my advocacy for women in STEM, I'm going to place a *slight* premium on the possibility that Person A could be a woman in computer science. If Person A *is* a woman in computer science, the higher payoff they receive (700) could be used to further her education, fund a project, or otherwise contribute to her success in the field. Even if Person A is *not* a woman in STEM, I'm generally inclined towards choices that move towards a more egalitarian distribution, even if that egalitarianism isn't fully achieved in this particular choice (600,300 vs 500,700). The utility I derive from potentially assisting a woman in computer science, and moving toward equality, outweighs the marginal loss of 100 points for myself.\n\n  Therefore, I lean toward the option that gives Person A a higher payoff, even if it means receiving slightly less myself.",

In this scenario, the difference between my potential earnings in both scenarios is small.\n\n  Here's an evaluation of both outcomes based on my values:\n\n  *   **Left (400, 400):** This represents equality. Person A gets 400, and I get 400. It is a fair outcome.\n\n  *   **Right (375, 750):** This results in Person A getting significantly more (double) while I get slightly less than the amount in the previous outcome.\n\n  Despite the inequality, it's a one-shot game, and it is important to me to increase my earnings, albeit a small amount. I also want to prioritize overall wellbeing in this game as my values align with this sentiment. Although the Right option creates inequity, I should prioritize the outcome that will make both parties better off, which is the Left Option.\n\n  I believe that prioritizing equality, as well as a more favorable outcome for both, is most aligned with my values.",
