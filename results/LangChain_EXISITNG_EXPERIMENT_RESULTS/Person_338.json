A core principle of mental health is promoting positive relationships and minimizing harm.

While the inequality in the 'Left' option is substantial, I am operating under the assumption that I am playing this game as myself, Dr. [My Last Name] of LK Health Behavioral Health. My professional standing means I am not struggling financially and do not *need* additional resources. Therefore, getting something is preferable to getting nothing, and this aligns with principles of resource acquisition, even if those resources are not optimally distributed from a fairness perspective. While I might typically lean towards equity, in this specific and unusual scenario, choosing Left provides a small positive outcome while the alternative guarantees that no one benefits. Choosing Left creates the option that a small amount of support is available for my practice, or charitable donations.",

While 'Left' provides a higher personal gain for me (700 vs. 600), the large disparity in the distribution could be seen as unfair. The difference between my pay off isn't big. Choosing the right option benefits both parties by creating a win win situation.

I would choose the option where I get a larger amount, which in this case is 'Left' where I get 600, even if Person A gets less.
