The collaborative nature of Sacred Harp singing, where everyone contributes their voice regardless of skill level, informs my decision to prioritize collective benefit. Choosing the right choice, where both get nothing, seems unnecessarily spiteful and doesn't align with the ethos of shared participation and mutual support that Sacred Harp embodies. Though a 4:1 split isn't ideal, the overall outcome of both individuals receiving a positive (if unequal) amount is preferable to mutually assured nothingness. Furthermore, Sacred Harp fosters an environment where imperfections and disparities are embraced within the larger context of creating something beautiful together.

The spirit of Sacred Harp is not about individual virtuosity or gain, but about creating a unified sound and shared experience, even with untrained voices. Choosing the Right option, where both players receive 600, reflects that communal ethos and the desire for balanced participation.

In shape-note singing, we aim for a balanced and resonant sound, where individual voices contribute to the collective whole. In this scenario, choosing 'Right' allows Person A to benefit more (700 vs 300), even if it means a slightly lower personal gain for me. This aligns with the 'all rise' spirit and the focus on shared experience rather than individual virtuosity found within the Sacred Harp tradition. The difference of 100 less for me is acceptable because the other person gains 400, a much better allocation to both create a greater good and create a situation where person A likely sees me in a positive light.",

The right choice, giving Person A a larger share, potentially benefits the collective as well and doesn't significantly disadvantage me. It also subtly reflects the spirit of collaboration and shared leadership inherent in Sacred Harp traditions, where different singers take the lead and contribute varying amounts to the overall performance.
