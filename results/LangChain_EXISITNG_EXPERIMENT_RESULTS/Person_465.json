Choosing 'Right' gives Person A significantly more (750 vs. 400). While I'm primarily focused on my business, there's no downside for me to choose 'Right', and it benefits another individual. There's no strategic advantage gained by choosing 'Left'. My core responsibility centers around the company, and this individual decision isn't tied to that. Therefore, choosing Right shows a degree of corporate social responsibility, as I'm choosing a solution that's beneficial to another individual without negatively impacting my own position.

Furthermore, extreme greed might be perceived negatively, potentially impacting my business reputation, even indirectly.
