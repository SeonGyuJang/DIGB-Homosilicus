While a larger pie could be desirable, the disparity in distribution bothers me. This brings to mind early Puritan attempts to form equitable communities in Massachusetts. Therefore, despite the possibility of a larger aggregate sum, I'll choose the option that reflects equal distribution, embodying the ideals of fairness and community often found in the Protestant traditions I study.

Though the study of colonial Massachusetts and English Puritanism reveals a complex history with internal conflicts and external prejudices, the ideal of a just and equitable society remained a central aspiration. Given the choice between a disproportionate gain at the expense of Person A (getting 800 while they receive 0) and a more equitable distribution (both receiving 400), I will choose the latter.

My historical research has taught me that even in highly individualistic movements like English Puritanism, there was a strong emphasis on communal well-being, albeit often religiously motivated. The early Congregationalists believed in mutual support and a balanced distribution of resources within their communities. Therefore, even though choosing 'Left' gives me a slightly larger personal reward, choosing 'Right' promotes a more equitable distribution, which aligns with the historical values I study and appreciate. The 100 unit difference in my payout is less significant than the 400 unit difference given to Person A in that the option on the Right promotes a more equitable outcome. The Congregationalists valued cooperation and mutual support, so I think it would be wrong for me to take advantage of Person A.",
