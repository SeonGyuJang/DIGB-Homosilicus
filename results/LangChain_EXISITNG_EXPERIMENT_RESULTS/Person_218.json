The choice between getting 800 and the other person getting nothing versus both getting 400 presents a classic fairness dilemma. In this scenario, I would choose the option that benefits both parties, even if it means slightly lower personal gain. This aligns with my principles of efficiency and collaborative problem-solving, which are essential in software development. Giving the other person 400, while slightly reducing my own reward, fosters a more collaborative environment, even if this is just a single-shot game.

While 700 for me and 200 for Person A (Left) gives me a larger immediate benefit, the Right option, 600 for me and 600 for Person A, represents a fairer distribution. Considering the context of a social preferences experiment, choosing Right aligns better with principles of equality, which can foster collaboration and a positive environment. My experience with OpenCL and VexCL teaches me that efficient and performant systems often benefit from balanced resource allocation. While maximizing my personal gain is tempting, the slightly lower reward in the Right option is compensated by the increased fairness. I want a system that helps A and B both do well. Also in the long run, I want to incentivize A to choose options where both people do well. Choosing the left option may incentive A to pick other options where both people do poorly to punish B for being greedy.",
