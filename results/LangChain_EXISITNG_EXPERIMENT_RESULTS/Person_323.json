Choosing the 'Right' option, where both Person A and I receive 400, promotes equality and shared benefit. While maximizing my own gain (choosing 'Left') might seem appealing in a purely self-interested context, the ethical implications of my role as an advocate for Native American rights and my broader commitment to social justice encourage me to select the more equitable option. Since the experiment involves no actual Native Americans, I can separate this hypothetical exercise from the historical context without causing harm.
