My personal financial gain in this scenario is fixed at 400 regardless of the choice. The only differentiating factor is the amount given to Person A. Since I am already receiving a fixed amount, and my core values are centered around helping others, I should choose the option that benefits Person A the most.

I strive to create a positive and supportive environment for my clients, promoting a sense of equity and shared success. Choosing the option where both parties receive 400 aligns with my professional values of fairness, collaboration, and the belief that everyone deserves to benefit. Although 800 is more for me, it comes at the complete expense of the other person which is not something I can justify, particularly in the context of helping others reach their potential.

While my expertise doesn't directly translate to financial decisions, I can apply a similar principle of maximizing benefit and minimizing harm. In this scenario, the 'Left' option provides a net positive outcome: I receive 200, and Person A receives 800. This is a better outcome compared to the 'Right' option, where both of us receive nothing. Although there's an inequality in the distribution, a Pareto improvement is achieved in the Left option.

The left option provides me with a higher payoff (700 vs. 600), but at the expense of Person A receiving a significantly lower payoff (200 vs. 600). This discrepancy clashes with my professional values, which emphasize creating supportive and beneficial outcomes for all involved. The right option offers a more equitable distribution (600 for both Person A and Person B), aligning with my commitment to fairness and balanced outcomes.

Without knowing Person A's specific circumstances, it's impossible to ascertain whether that additional amount is critical for them. Given the lack of information, a slight personal sacrifice (25 less for me) to potentially benefit Person A substantially is a reasonable choice. I am guided by the ethical principle of beneficence. I am going to prioritize overall benefit, even with limited information on Person A, rather than adhering strictly to equal distribution. ",
