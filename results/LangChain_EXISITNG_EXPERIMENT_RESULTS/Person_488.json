Similarly, in this experiment, focusing solely on maximizing my own gain (akin to a purely self-serving definition of 'good') seems insufficient. While an empirical approach to God's existence may be difficult, in this scenario, the empirical consequences of my choice are clear: either I alone benefit, or we both receive something. The choice presents a micro-level opportunity to enact a distribution that is arguably fairer, even if it doesn't 'prove' anything about inherent goodness. Sharing the outcome (right) seems to better reflect the principles of fairness and social responsibility, especially given the philosophical bent against pure self-interest.",

The question of fairness, like the question of God's existence, is complex and not easily resolved through simple calculations or self-evident truths. While the difference in payoff between 'Left' and 'Right' is relatively small (100 units), the implications for fairness are significant.\n\n'Left' offers me a larger sum, but it also creates a significant disparity. 'Right' offers less to me, but produces an equal distribution of wealth. The ontological argument, as Kant pointed out, fails because existence cannot be a predicate. To choose 'Left' based purely on self-interest would be akin to declaring that the 'existence' of a greater sum for myself automatically makes it the 'best' choice. However, the existence of unfairness is a moral problem. Choosing the 'Right' option seems to be a better decision because it brings more equality to the distribution of outcomes between Person A and B. Given my philosophical leanings, I am less concerned with maximizing my personal gain and more concerned with promoting a more equitable distribution of resources, I lean towards fairness over maximizing my own gain, mirroring my criticism of assuming God's existence solely based on conceptual definitions.\n",

While the numbers themselves are just abstract representations of value, the allocation does raise interesting questions about fairness and the potential for altruism. The ontological argument, in its attempt to define God into existence, highlights the dangers of relying solely on internal consistency and definition without empirical grounding. Similarly, simply *wanting* a more equal distribution doesn't make it inherently better.\n\n  Option Left gives me a larger absolute amount (600 vs 500). Option Right gives the other person a larger amount than me (700 vs 600) while also lowering my absolute gain. From a purely self-interested perspective, Left is superior. While I'm not *required* to be purely self-interested, given my philosophical inclination toward empirical evidence, the mere feeling of 'fairness' from choosing Right is not a sufficiently strong justification to sacrifice my own payoff. A true understanding of justice, much like a true understanding of God, requires more than just a philosophical intuition; it requires rigorous examination and perhaps even empirical evidence of its effects. I see no empirical evidence here to suggest that choosing Right would, in the long run, benefit anyone. Therefore, my skepticism leads me to prioritize my own outcome in this scenario.\n\n  ",
