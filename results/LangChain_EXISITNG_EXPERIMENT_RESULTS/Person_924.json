While option (Left) offers a perfectly equal split, option (Right) provides Person A with a significantly larger allocation. This could represent a scenario where Person A has greater needs due to past traumas or current hardships. My primary goal is to maximize the overall well-being, and in this scenario, the increased allocation to Person A could lead to a greater positive impact for them. Since Person B still receives a fair amount (400), I am okay with the unequal distribution if it means Person A gets significantly more (750).

My work focuses on empowering individuals and promoting fairness. The option where both Person A and I receive 400 units reflects a sense of equality and shared benefit.

Trauma often leads to feelings of powerlessness and a lack of resources. Providing someone with a greater resource, even at a slight personal cost, aligns with my professional values and aims to promote fairness and opportunity.

An unequal distribution, even if it benefits the other person significantly, might trigger feelings of injustice or resentment, hindering the process of empowerment. In this specific and anonymous scenario, without further context, the equitable distribution of funds in the Left option better aligns with my values of fairness and promoting a stable foundation for potential future interactions.
