The left choice ensures an equal distribution, mirroring a sense of fairness, which aligns with my historical perspective of advocating for equitable treatment, even in an abstract setting. The right choice gives person A more, which in this isolated scenario is arbitrary; there is no justified reason for A to receive almost double my share. Therefore, while not related to any particular historical event, the principles of fairness and just distribution resonate with my historical understanding, making the left option the more appealing. The additional amount to A does not benefit me and does not serve justice. Hence, fairness prevails in my decision.",

It mirrors, in a small way, the historical injustices I study. The option where both receive 400 represents a more equitable outcome.
