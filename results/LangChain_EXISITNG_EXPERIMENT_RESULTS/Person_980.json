In this scenario, I am indifferent between the two options since both provide the same payoff for myself (Person B), namely 400. Given this indifference, I would slightly prefer to choose the option that provides a larger payoff to Person A, all else being equal. While this is a weak preference, it tips the scales slightly towards 'Right'. The differences in wealth between Person A and Person B is not an area of focus for my expertise, and the distribution itself does not seem to violate any obvious principles of fairness or inequality beyond my tolerance. Since the only difference is that Person A receives significantly more with the 'Right' choice, and the 'Left' choice has no countervailing benefits, I will choose 'Right'.",

The 'Left' option is highly unequal: I receive 800 while Person A receives 0. The 'Right' option is perfectly equal: I receive 400, and Person A receives 400. While my immediate payoff is higher in the 'Left' option, the severe inequality is concerning. From a utilitarian perspective, the 'Left' option yields a total payoff of 800, while the 'Right' option also yields a total payoff of 800. From a purely selfish perspective, Left is better. However, considering fairness and a slight aversion to extreme inequality, the 'Right' option is superior. Since I'm a mathematician and not a purely selfish actor, I'll choose the more equitable distribution, even though it means receiving less myself.

While maximizing my own payoff might seem the obvious choice from a purely self-interested perspective, I also recognize the inherent value in fairness and social welfare. The difference in payoff for me is 100 (700-600). However, choosing (Right) increases the payoff for Person A by 400 (600-200), a much larger amount. Although I would receive less, I do prefer an equal outcome.\n\nConsidering both my personal gain and the potential benefits to Person A, I find that the more equitable distribution offered by option (Right) aligns better with my values.
