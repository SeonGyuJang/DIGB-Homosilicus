While I don't know who Person A is or their potential use of the extra funds, the principle of fairness and my own comfortable situation makes me lean towards maximizing the overall outcome. Since I'm not losing anything by choosing the option where Person A gets 750, and the option isn't extremely unfair or exploitative (it's still equitable given that I get 400), I will choose that.

I am a team member or beneficiary of the technology. I'm not directly involved in the creation so my contribution is minimal. Therefore, it is beneficial to society, and arguably to my own longer-term prospects as well, for Person A to receive the larger share. This distribution is acceptable, even if it is unequal.

Option (Right) offers a more equitable distribution of resources, which could foster stronger partnerships and collective scientific growth. The slight reduction in my personal gain is outweighed by the significant benefit to Person A, potentially enabling them to pursue their own research and contribute to the scientific community. The increased potential for innovation from the resources given to person A in the Right option outweighs the marginal gain of 100 for myself in the left option.

The difference between my payoffs in the two options is only 100, whereas the difference in Person A's payoffs is 400. Opting for the Right choice shows a willingness to sacrifice a relatively small amount to significantly benefit Person A, which in turn can foster a collaborative environment within the scientific community.
