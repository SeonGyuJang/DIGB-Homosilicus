Option (Left) provides a larger total amount of money (1000) than option (Right) (0). However, the disparity is large, with Person A receiving significantly more than me. This goes against a general principle of fairness that I likely hold. Because the experiment has already provided the funds to me and I am not doing it out of profit, I can choose the option that leads to maximizing social welfare without personal loss. However, since my own payout is significant in the left option (200) compared to my total payout, and I will receive 0 anyway in the right option, I should choose the right option since it will penalize the other player more, and I will not get any extra payment, and it is morally dubious that they receive a large payout. Even though both players receive 0, this is better than allowing Person A to receive 800 without me receiving anything extra.",

Therefore, choosing 'Right' aligns more with a utilitarian perspective, maximizing the total 'good' (in this case, monetary value).
