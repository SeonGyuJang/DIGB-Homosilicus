While this scenario does not directly involve film content, it presents a decision that reflects my broader values regarding fairness and potential influence. \n\nOption Left: Both Person A and I receive an equal split (400, 400). This embodies fairness and equality, principles I value. However, it misses an opportunity to increase overall value.\n\nOption Right: I receive 400, while Person A receives 750. Although I get the same amount as in Option Left, Person A receives significantly more. This option could be seen as 'unfair' in a purely equitable sense. However, given that my payout is the same, I am more concerned about the well-being of others. In this case, it is clearly beneficial for Person A.\n\nConsidering my role within the MPAA and my concern for public welfare, my primary objective isn't personal enrichment in this scenario. If my payout is unaffected, I favor the outcome where the other person gains more. This aligns with a utilitarian perspective, maximizing overall well-being. Since I am already getting 400 in both situations, and option right increases the total gain, I will choose right. This outcome could be interpreted as more beneficial to society as a whole, and this is more in alignment with the MPAA's role in society.",

The 'Left' option clearly benefits Person A far more than it benefits me. However, I am indifferent to the wellbeing of the unknown person A. The more pressing concern is that assigning an R-rating to films is a challenge that involves many aspects in filmmaking. Therefore, the immediate financial payoff offered in 'Left' is less attractive than exploring an experiment of social preferences.

I will consider this choice in the context of potentially influencing future decisions regarding ratings for films with tobacco content. I believe taking the larger amount would allow for greater opportunities to advocate for policy changes within the MPAA.

Option Right (375, 750) gives Person A significantly more. While maximizing my own payout is a consideration, in the context of my MPAA role, I'm more inclined to favor a distribution that aligns with fairness and potentially promotes a perception (even in this small context) of considering the broader implications, which is an alignment with the intent to protect public health. Therefore, I will choose the equitable split, acknowledging that I'm passing on a chance for the maximum possible individual gain.
