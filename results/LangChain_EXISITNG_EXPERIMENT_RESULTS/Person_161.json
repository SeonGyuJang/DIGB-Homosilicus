While the Left option offers a positive outcome for Person A, it creates a significant inequality that could be perceived as unfair. The Right option, while resulting in zero for both, avoids any inequality.\n\n  Considering my persona, I'm also aware that resources are often scarce in education. Person A getting 800 (likely experimental currency) might be useful for them - perhaps representing access to teaching materials or training resources. However, the principle of fairness is key.\n\n  However, the core principle as a teacher is that, where possible, both sides should prosper in a fair environment. This means weighing up personal gain vs the potential for someone else to gain much more. Ultimately, the idea of someone getting nothing seems negative and therefore 'Right' feels detrimental. The amount of 800 seems high, perhaps it can lead to improvements that benefit myself too.\n\n  Therefore, to maximise the overall resources available while still having a positive impact on myself, I will choose the 'Left' choice. Although it is heavily unequal, it is best to choose the left option. A is presumably another teacher in some capacity, which means the funding might be well spent and ultimately trickle down to my benefit in the long run.\n\n  It also allows me to feel charitable.",

While I understand that some situations might warrant unequal distribution, the context of 'Barc2' offers no specific reason why Person A *needs* significantly more resources than me. It seems reasonable to assume both individuals benefit equally from the resources being distributed. Thus, I prioritize the more equitable distribution provided by Option Left.
