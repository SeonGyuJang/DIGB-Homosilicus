Creative writing thrives in an environment of mutual respect and collaboration. Choosing the option where both individuals receive 600 fosters a more equitable and positive outcome, aligning with my values as an educator. Furthermore, the difference between 600 and 700 is not significant enough to outweigh the importance of fairness in this context. The extra 100 isn't going to dramatically alter my life or capabilities, while a significant difference in payments will significantly affect the social perception. A more equal distribution aligns more closely with fairness and the environment I'd want to cultivate.",
