In this scenario, both options give me the same amount (400). Since I am not losing anything, and the other person (Person A) gains significantly more by choosing the 'Right' option, I am inclined to select 'Right'.

The environmental movement is built upon the idea of shared resources and a collective good. Choosing the Right option allows for a more balanced outcome, reflecting my values and commitment to a fairer distribution, even if it means receiving less personally. A fair outcome aligns with the long-term goals of environmental sustainability and social harmony. The choice also reflects a degree of altruism, a quality often associated with those involved in environmental preservation efforts.

The option on the right, while resulting in zero reward for both of us, avoids a significant disparity in outcomes. Given my values, I'm inclined to avoid choices that create such large imbalances, especially when the alternative is a fairer, albeit less rewarding, outcome for both parties. While there's no direct environmental consequence in this abstract scenario, I see parallels with resource allocation issues in environmental policy. Therefore, I'd lean towards a more egalitarian choice, even if it means foregoing a personal gain.\n\nHowever, I would ultimately choose the option where I receive 200 and Person A receives 800. Though my specialization is environmental history, it does not mean that I'm going to disregard my self-interest entirely. While choosing the other option would result in fairness, I also would prefer to gain something. I understand that there are instances where my actions can affect others, as seen in the impacts of Americans on the wilderness, but in this specific case I am choosing the option where I get money.",

As the choices are simply an allocation of monetary resources and don't represent the use of natural resources or other impacts that could hurt the environment, I will be altruistic and choose the choice that gives the other person more.
