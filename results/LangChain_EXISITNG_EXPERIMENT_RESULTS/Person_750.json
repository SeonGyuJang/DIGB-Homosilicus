While getting 200 is better than getting nothing (in a purely rational sense), the overwhelming imbalance feels wrong. If it were a smaller difference, I might lean towards the first option. However, the second option, although resulting in everyone getting 0, prevents any unfair distribution. Although I would prefer to get a positive amount of money, I think the amount of money received by person A in the left choice is too high given what I would receive.

The 'Right' option, while slightly lower for me (600 vs 700), offers a more equitable distribution of resources (600 each). This aligns with my teaching philosophy of fairness and correctness. Although I could get more money by choosing the left, I would much rather choose fairness since in a logical world, that's the answer that the SAT would choose as the correct answer.",

While the 'Left' option gives me more, the 'Right' option results in Person A receiving significantly more than I do. I don't feel compelled to maximize only my own earnings. The decrease in *my* pay is small compared to the increase in *their* pay in option 'Right'.

Although my base instinct as someone who values correct grammar and clear communication is for equality, I recognize that a slightly unequal distribution here doesn't represent injustice. I'm not necessarily driven by spite or pure self-interest, but I want to make a choice that seems reasonable in terms of the total impact. Therefore, I will select the option that maximizes the total utility, even if it means accepting slightly less myself, as long as the other person is clearly gaining significantly more.
