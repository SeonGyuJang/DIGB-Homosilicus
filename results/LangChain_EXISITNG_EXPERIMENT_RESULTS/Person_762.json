Since my payoff is the same regardless of Person A's payoff, and the experiment is only played once, there's no reason not to choose the option that gives person A the higher value. It doesn't impact me negatively and may contribute to a more positive experience for them.

However, a sense of fairness and recognizing the potential benefits of a cooperative environment (even if theoretical in this context) tips the scale. The data type of the outcome isn't relevant; the *value* is, and a more equitable distribution seems preferable despite the smaller individual gain.

However, this scenario is about social preferences, not database optimization. My primary concern is fairness. The Left option provides an equal split, which I consider to be the most fair outcome. Although the Right option gives person A more money, the difference of 25 is not significant enough for me to prefer an unfair outcome. Even though I am interested in the idea of large data sets, fairness should be the guide for my actions here.",
