Moreover, historical study often reveals the societal impacts of unequal resource distribution. Thus, in the absence of any other information, I will opt for the more equal division.\n\nConsidering my interests in history, measurement, justice, business, and devotion, choosing equal outcomes reflects a sense of medieval communal responsibility or an understanding of fair dealing in craft traditions.",

Since I receive at least something (200), I consider that the more valuable choice, irrespective of Person A's share.

My historical perspective emphasizes the inherent inequalities that often existed within medieval societies. While I am not actively striving to recreate or perpetuate such inequalities, I recognize that absolute equality wasn't the norm. The potential impact of the difference is likely small, though the percentage difference between what Person A receives is considerable. I also see a small personal loss by choosing the unequal distribution. Since I am a historian in the area of medieval economic distribution, I realize that differences in resources usually make their way from the rich to the poor, so choosing Right is likely the best choice.",
