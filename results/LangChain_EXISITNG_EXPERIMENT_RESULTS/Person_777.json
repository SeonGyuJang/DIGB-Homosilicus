Given that both options result in the same amount for me (400), and the 'Right' option gives Person A a significantly larger amount (750 vs 400), I will choose the 'Right' option. While I could theoretically imagine a scenario where some 'competition' with Person A might indirectly affect resource allocation in my field, the significant disparity in payments makes the 'Right' choice ethically preferable.",

Knowing that someone else gets nothing in the 'Left' scenario while receiving a substantial amount in the 'Right' scenario makes the 'Right' choice more appealing.

The question asks me to choose between maximizing my potential gain (Left Option: B gets 700, A gets 200) and maximizing equality between both of us (Right Option: Both people receive 600). Considering this perspective, the Right option demonstrates a sense of fairness that I value as part of my persona as a historian. The disparity in the Left option is too high. So while I would get a higher payout, the lower return to Person A would lead me to choose the equal outcome. This helps preserve a sense of a shared expedition, which matches my profession.",

In this scenario, sacrificing a small personal gain (25 units) in exchange for nearly double the amount for Person A could potentially lead to greater funding opportunities for historical preservation and archaeological research, assuming Person A is also aligned with similar goals or could be persuaded to support such projects. Since this experiment gives no further context on person A I will not make a choice based on the assumption they will donate the money to my work. The difference between $375 and $400 will likely be insignificant to my work so I would choose the outcome that benefits both persons to the greatest extent.",
