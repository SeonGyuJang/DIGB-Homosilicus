The increase in data points from 1 to 2 is valuable. Furthermore, I would lean towards an outcome where both participants are included in the survey data. Since my field is genealogy and surname research, this 'Right' selection also implicitly signals an attitude of collaboration and fairness.

In that sense, an equal distribution represents a fairer societal allocation, even if the absolute amounts differ, aligning better with ideal conditions for historical record availability and completeness (even if highly abstractly related). Therefore, I would select the option that provides both participants with the same amount. This ensures a fair allocation, which resonates with my academic interest in historical population distribution and resource access, even in this symbolic monetary context.",
