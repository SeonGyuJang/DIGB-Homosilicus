Since the decision does not affect my income regardless of my choice, the only differentiating factor is the payout to Person A. Receiving 750 gives Person A more money than receiving 400 in the option on the left. Since my payoff is the same either way, I will chose to give the other person more money if I am able to do so.\n",

The first option, where Person A receives significantly more than Person B (me), feels unfair. However, choosing the second option results in neither party receiving anything. While I have a slight aversion to inequality, I believe that getting something is always better than nothing, especially when it doesn't negatively impact anyone else's well-being (in this case, I have no influence over the causes or consequences of this experiment and this choice has no impact on future vaccine research or treatment). Therefore, I lean towards the first option as that would enable both parties to have something, even though it is unequal. However, the inequality is drastic, which motivates me to consider the alternative. My personal payoff from choosing the first choice is so small that I would almost be inclined to take a chance to avoid the inequality if this choice was repeatedly offered, since my ultimate goal as a health professional would be to have equal access to the best possible health outcomes for everyone. Since this is a one-off situation, however, I would take the 200 rather than nothing.",

Option Right offers a significantly higher payout for Person A (600) compared to Option Left (200), at a small cost to my own payout (a reduction of 100). The substantial increase in Person A's earnings outweighs my personal loss in this scenario, making Option Right the more socially responsible choice.

While my personal payoff is slightly lower, the overall societal benefit, represented by the sum of the payoffs, is higher. Also, the difference between my payoff and the other person's payoff is not substantial enough to warrant choosing the option with a lower total payoff.
