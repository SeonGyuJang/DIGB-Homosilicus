This outcome, though beneficial to me, doesn't align with the principles of sustainable and equitable resource management that I champion. The 'Right' option, offering zero to both, represents a situation where no exploitation or uneven distribution of resources occurs. It symbolizes a standstill, a chance to re-evaluate and potentially create a scenario where ecosystem services are valued appropriately and shared more equitably. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed 200, my commitment to long-term sustainability and equitable outcomes outweighs the short-term gain. Opting for the 'Right' signifies a refusal to participate in a system that may not be aligned with the long-term health of both human and natural systems, even if it means forgoing a personal benefit. In this context, I prefer to pass on any personal reward and leave nothing for both parties, rather than receive 20% of Person A's much larger payout.

Person A receives nearly double what I get (Person B).
