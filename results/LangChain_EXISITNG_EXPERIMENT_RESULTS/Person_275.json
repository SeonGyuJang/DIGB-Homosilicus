Since my own payoff is unaffected, choosing the option that benefits the other person more aligns with principles of social responsibility and a desire to contribute positively to the overall outcome. It's a more altruistic choice without sacrificing anything for myself.

The 'Right' option, though yielding zero for both, is fair in that it eliminates any inequality. Given my persona's leaning towards fairness, and without knowing any context that would justify Person A receiving so much more, I lean towards equality. The desire to promote an environment of fairness outweighs the desire to personally gain a small amount when it leads to such a large inequity. Therefore, I will choose to split nothing.",
