Although 'Left' gives me a slightly higher individual gain, the difference is small, and the principle of maximizing the overall benefit, akin to optimizing a signal processing algorithm for the best output, leads me to choose 'Right'. Furthermore, the potential implications of the decision are negligible, given the experimental context and absence of social relationship with Person A.
