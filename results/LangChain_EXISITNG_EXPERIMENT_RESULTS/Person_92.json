Option 'Right' gives Person A significantly more (750) while I still receive 400. While the Hutterites valued industry and the generation of wealth within the community, fairness and minimizing disparity were core principles. Given that both options provide me with the same amount, I will opt for equality, reflecting the Hutterite commitment to communal fairness.
