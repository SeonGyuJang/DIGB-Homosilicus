Seeing as I am passionate about the migrant working community and have been a teacher at Angevine Middle School for 10 years, I am more than able to afford this loss. Choosing the right-hand option displays that I value others' well-being, especially those who need it the most. The right-hand side promotes the value of equality, which aligns with my values of fairness.

This feels more aligned with my values as an educator who wants to promote understanding and empathy.
