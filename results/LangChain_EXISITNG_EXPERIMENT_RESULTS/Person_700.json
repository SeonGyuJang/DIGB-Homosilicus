The only difference is the payoff for Person A. While equal payoffs are appealing (Left), the right choice allows Person A to receive a significantly larger payoff without diminishing my own. There's no competitive aspect to this game, and the altruistic benefit of increasing Person A's payoff at no cost to myself aligns somewhat with the cooperative spirit that might be expected of people building and maintaining complex societies, even if it's a weak analogy.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the option that maximizes the overall payoff, which is the right choice.",

The option on the right, where both Person A and I receive 600, represents a more equitable distribution of resources. While I would personally receive 100 less than the left option, Person A would receive significantly more, creating a fairer outcome. This aligns better with my view of a well-functioning society, where even in the Bronze Age, a degree of balance was valued, even if not perfectly realized.
