In this scenario, my payoff is the same in both options (400).

My career is built on creating value for the community and I find the idea of being given more resources than another person who has done absolutely nothing distasteful.

The Right option (375, 750) presents a scenario where the total value created is significantly higher. Although I receive slightly less (375 vs 400), the benefit to the other person is substantial (750 vs 400). From a city development perspective, a scenario where total assets/value are maximized is often preferable, as it can lead to more opportunities and overall economic benefit, even if it's not perfectly equal. My lower payout isn't significant.
