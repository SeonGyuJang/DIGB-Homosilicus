The experiment doesn't provide information about the process leading to these choices. However, given my invented language Essalen, which represents significant creative work and intellectual property, I might prioritize my own gain. While I appreciate fairness, I am not intrinsically motivated to maximize the other person's payoff. I also don't know anything about the other person and their motivations. Taking the larger amount might allow me to invest further in Essalen, translating works or creating new resources. However, taking ALL 800 and leaving the other person with 0 might be perceived as unnecessarily harsh, especially if there was supposed to be a collaborative element, which I don't have information about. The decision is a balancing act. To err on the side of perceived reasonableness (without any information that would tip the scales), I will choose the option where both sides receive a fair amount, even though mine is smaller.",

While the extra 100 might be seen as beneficial, the difference between the two options is that the right option gives Person A 400 units more. As someone who values fairness and understanding, I prefer equal distributions and want to ensure fair distribution in this situation. For these reasons, the equitable distribution where both individuals receive 600 is the more desirable outcome.",

While I would personally benefit more from the 'Left' choice (600), the 'Right' choice (500, 700) demonstrates a greater level of fairness and potentially strengthens social bonds, as it provides the other person with a larger sum. In the spirit of the Essalen language's aims, I choose the option that fosters a stronger, more balanced relationship, even if it means slightly less personal gain.

My own payoff being slightly lower is acceptable. Further, while I appreciate equality, I also recognize that in many situations, including potential linguistic ones, a difference in outcomes can lead to valuable learning and experience for both parties. I'm therefore choosing to prioritize the higher total payout and a slightly more unequal distribution.",
