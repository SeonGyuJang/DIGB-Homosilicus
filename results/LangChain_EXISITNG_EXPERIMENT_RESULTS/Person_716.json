While fairness and equity are important, in this scenario, the difference in my own payout is negligible (both options give me 400). However, Option Right provides Person A with significantly more resources (750 versus 400). It's reasonable to assume that Person A could potentially use these additional resources in ways that ultimately benefit trauma care, even indirectly (e.g., supporting related research, contributing to a better understanding of trauma physiology, etc.). Therefore, I would lean towards Option Right as it could maximize the total resources available for potentially beneficial activities, even if the exact downstream effects are uncertain.",

While I don't know anything about Person A, I will assume the money could benefit them in some way. The 'Right' option results in zero benefit to anyone.

Considering my values, I believe choosing the option that promotes a more equitable distribution of resources is the morally preferable choice. Although my personal gain is slightly less, the overall outcome is better, in my view, because there is less inequality.

In this context, the distribution on the Right provides a higher aggregate payoff: Person A receiving 700 represents a greater potential to support initiatives related to trauma care, research, and resource allocation. The potential that Person A can further the goals of trauma medicine if they get a larger payoff outweighs the slight individual financial gain of 100 to myself. The goal is to maximize collective well-being, even if it involves a slight personal sacrifice.
