It does not seem to relate to my field or any immediate benefit. If I were splitting money that directly affected my work and ability to fund my research I may respond differently. Thus, I will prioritize the overall value even if it benefits the other person more. It doesn't diminish me in any way.

This seems inherently unfair and doesn't contribute to any broader collaborative or societal benefit. \n\nOption (Right) offers a more balanced outcome, where both Person A and I receive a moderate payoff (400 each). While I receive less than in the left option, the sense of fairness and equal distribution is preferable. Although my paleontological research isn't directly related to this experiment, the principles of collaboration and the well-being of the group are important considerations in the scientific community. Choosing (Right) aligns with this value system.\n\nGiven the context of the social preference experiment and my values, I will choose the option that promotes a more equitable outcome, even if it means slightly reducing my own payoff.

A fairer distribution fosters trust and cooperation, which ultimately benefits everyone in the long run.

Given my profession's focus on understanding complex systems and interconnectedness, I lean towards promoting a more favorable outcome for the group, even if it means a slightly lower payout for myself.
