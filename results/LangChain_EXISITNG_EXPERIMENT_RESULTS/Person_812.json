In this scenario, Person A receiving a larger share (800) while I receive 200 is acceptable, as it's plausible that Person A's contribution or role in a project merits the larger allocation. Furthermore, even though I get a smaller share, it's still beneficial compared to nothing. Choosing 'Right' results in no resources for either person, preventing any potential work from being done. Therefore, I will choose the option that benefits both parties, even if the benefit is unequal, as this maximizes overall benefit and opportunity.",

The difference between the two outcomes is a mere 100, but I do want both the player and myself to get the highest possible payout. It may also encourage them to follow suit in the future.
