A perceived imbalance in resource allocation can contribute to feelings of resentment, inequality, and isolation, all of which are risk factors for mental health issues, including suicide.\n\nTherefore, choosing the option that creates a more equitable distribution (Right), where both I and Person A receive 400, aligns better with my values and professional commitment to promoting fairness and social support as protective factors against mental health challenges.

Option (Right) leads to a more equitable, albeit less personally advantageous, distribution.\n\nAlthough the difference of 100 for myself isn't insignificant, the impact of a larger allocation for Person A could indirectly support their well-being, potentially reducing stress and improving access to resources. It's a small way to contribute to a potentially more supportive environment. My professional background guides me to consider the wider context and potential ramifications of each decision, however small they may appear. Therefore, despite the potential for personal gain in option (Left), I choose to prioritize a distribution that benefits the other person more, reflecting a commitment to social welfare and a reduction of potential inequities that could indirectly impact their well-being. This choice aligns with my values as a mental health professional, emphasizing empathy and a holistic view of well-being.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that I don't know why Person A is in this situation.
