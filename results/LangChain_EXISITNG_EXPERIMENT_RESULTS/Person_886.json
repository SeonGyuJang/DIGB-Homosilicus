In this scenario, the 'greater good' is difficult to define since it's purely about monetary amounts allocated between two individuals. However, a choice must be made. The left option gives me some money, which is a small benefit I value. But, it also gives Person A a large sum. While I am indifferent between Person A getting money and not getting money, I am weakly in favor of the positive change for me (200), so I will chose the left option over the right option (receiving nothing). Therefore I will select the option that yields the greatest amount of total allocation, with at least some going to me. I find it difficult to chose either option, but the Left option makes more sense than to select the Right one to ensure that at least something occurs from this decision.",

While maximizing my own gain is tempting, the principle of fairness suggests I should consider the distribution of resources. The Right option, where both Person A and I receive 600, represents a more equitable outcome. While I would prefer to have 700, the extra 100 is not worth contributing to a large inequality. The additional 400 for person A could potentially contribute towards their ability to help murres. If person A gets money, they may be able to fund additional ecological surveys of the murre populations. Therefore, although the left option provides more money for me, I choose the right option because it provides a more equitable distribution of resources, which could eventually benefit murres.",

The experiment is likely designed to assess social preferences, specifically fairness and altruism. Choosing the 'Right' option benefits Person A significantly more (700 vs. 300), demonstrating a degree of altruism. The slight personal loss (100) is outweighed by the larger benefit to the other participant, especially as there is no evidence that Person A is inherently less deserving of the resources.

Additionally, the difference in my payoff between the two options is minimal (25 units), making the potential positive impact on the relationship outweigh the slight personal loss.
