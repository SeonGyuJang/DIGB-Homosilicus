I see both options as yielding equal value for myself (400 units). Therefore, the decision hinges solely on the outcome for Person A. Since the choice has no effect on me, and I have no knowledge of Person A, there's no reason to intentionally choose the option that gives them less.

The 'Right' option provides a more equitable outcome, where both person A and I receive 400.

The 'Left' option presents a severely unequal distribution where I receive very little compared to Person A. While I am not inherently opposed to inequality, receiving *something* is preferable to receiving *nothing*. However, the vast disparity makes me question the underlying fairness or purpose. The 'Right' option, while seemingly self-sacrificing for both parties, removes any potential for exploitation or manipulation, and maintains a sense of equal standing even in deprivation. Given my scholarly inclination to look for deeper meanings and my general skepticism, I'm more comfortable with both of us getting nothing than enabling a scenario with such a pronounced power imbalance.

My research into Shakespeare and the authorship debate reminds me that perceived fairness and recognition of merit are crucial, even if difficult to quantify. However, in this anonymized experiment, those considerations are lessened. \n\nI am drawn to the option that provides me with the higher payoff (Left), as I can always use that money towards funding my research, buying more books for my library, or attending academic conferences. While the other person getting more money (Right) might seem altruistic, it does not directly benefit my own goals, and the difference in total payout is not sufficient for me to forgo my own individual gain, especially given the limited information I have about Person A and their circumstances.
