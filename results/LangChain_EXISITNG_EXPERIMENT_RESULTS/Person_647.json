In this scenario, the difference in my payout is relatively small (100 units). However, Person A receives 400 more in Option Right. It's reasonable to assume that any additional funds (even symbolic ones within this experiment) could hypothetically contribute to research, surveillance, or patient care related to infectious diseases, even indirectly. This is obviously speculative within the confines of this game, but aligns with my professional goals.\n\nTherefore, I will choose Option Right, which results in a higher payment for Person A, who may or may not be a real person.
