This goes against my core values of reducing inequality and fostering a more level playing field. The 'Right' option, although resulting in zero for both, avoids exacerbating inequality. In the context of online education, I constantly grapple with similar decisions about resource allocation. While a perfect solution might not exist in this scenario (or in the real-world problems I tackle!), my commitment to fairness outweighs the temptation for personal gain, especially when it creates a large discrepancy.
