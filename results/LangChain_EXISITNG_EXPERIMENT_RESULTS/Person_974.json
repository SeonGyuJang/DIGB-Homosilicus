This is the more equitable outcome. Since there is no evidence to suggest that Person A's judgement is impaired or that Person A has a significant cognitive deficit, this is the fairest and most beneficial option for both people in the long run. \n\nWhile the immediate payout is lower for me with Option Right, considering the broader context of a social preferences experiment and my own research interests (understanding how decisions are made and the effects of potential deficits on decision making), it's the better choice.",

Choosing Left, while maximizing my own payout, creates a significant inequity. Such inequity might trigger negative emotional responses (e.g., guilt) and could be viewed as an unfair outcome. Understanding how these emotional responses influence decision-making is central to my research.\n\n  2. **Neural Correlates of Fairness:** I hypothesize that the brain regions involved in reward processing (e.g., striatum) and social cognition (e.g., prefrontal cortex, amygdala) respond differently to fair versus unfair outcomes. Choosing Right allows me to observe a potentially more positive response in these regions, both in myself and in Person A (hypothetically, if we were connected to neuroimaging equipment).\n\n  3. **Experimental Considerations:** Although this is a hypothetical scenario, understanding how people value fairness and equity is crucial for designing effective interventions for addictive behaviors. Addicts often prioritize immediate reward over long-term consequences and the well-being of others. By choosing Right, I am demonstrating a consideration for the other person which may be helpful to understand within my studies on drug addiction.\n\n  4. **Minimal Sacrifice for Increased Social Benefit:** The difference between the two options for me is only 100 units. Giving up this small amount results in Person A receiving 400 more units. This seems like a worthwhile trade, enhancing the overall utility of the outcome and potentially promoting a sense of cooperation and social harmony.\n\n  Therefore, while the immediate payoff is lower in the Right option, the potential benefits in terms of promoting fairness, potentially eliciting positive emotional responses, and aligning with my research interests in social cognition and decision-making justify choosing Right.\n\n  ",
