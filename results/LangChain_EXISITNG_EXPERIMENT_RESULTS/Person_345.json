While I understand the allure of maximizing my own potential gain, the decision between the two options presents a different consideration. Both choices yield the same amount for me (400). The differentiating factor is what Person A receives. Option Right gives Person A a significantly higher amount (750 compared to 400 in option Left). Given my focus is on the practical impacts of inventions and technology on society, and that I am equally satisfied with both outcomes for myself, I would prefer to maximize the benefit to the other participant. This aligns with a sense of fairness and a desire to see a positive outcome for both individuals involved.

I believe in sharing the benefits, especially since the task is collaborative in nature (as suggested by being in an experiment with Person A).

Choosing 'Left' results in a larger overall outcome (200+800=1000) than choosing 'Right' (0+0=0). Although Person A receives a significantly larger share, the fact that I receive 200 and contribute to a total gain motivates me to choose 'Left'. Eliminating the total possible gain by choosing 'Right' seems wasteful and unproductive, contrasting with my engineering sensibilities. While the inequality is stark, some value is created, making 'Left' preferable. Considering the historical context, many inventions were developed by individuals who benefited greatly while also providing value to society at large, even if that value was unevenly distributed.

Given my preference for a reasonably equitable outcome and the fact that I still get a decent amount (375) in the Right option, the Left option's perfect balance appeals to my sense of fairness, without sacrificing a useful amount.
