Choosing 'Left' establishes a possible precedent for future interactions; Person A now knows my behavior if they were to interact with me in the future. If 'Right' is chosen, nobody receives anything. While it might feel spiteful if A is acting selfishly, it does not allow for any opportunity for either person to gain from interaction. Ultimately, the immediate economic gain is a minor consideration compared to my principles. While it may benefit me directly to choose to receive 200 units, choosing the other option would destroy any benefits to Person A as well. Choosing to maximize outcomes overall would mean I choose 'Left'. If there is a potential for future cooperation or if Person A benefits greatly from my choice, I am more inclined to consider that option. I will choose left.",

Choosing 'Left' gives me a higher payout (600 vs. 500), but Person A receives a significantly lower amount (300 vs. 700). Choosing 'Right' means I receive less (500 vs 600), but Person A receives substantially more (700 vs 300).\n\nGiven my values as a conservationist who recognizes the importance of community well-being, I believe that promoting a more equitable distribution of resources is aligned with my goals. While a difference of 100 isn't huge for me, the difference of 400 is significant for Person A.

While I receive slightly less than in the left option, the overall benefit to Person A is much greater. \n\nIn this scenario, a slight personal reduction in payoff is acceptable to vastly increase the other person's payoff. A difference of only 25 seems a very small price to pay for a difference of 350 to the other person.\n\nIt is my strong belief that a fair distribution does not always mean complete equality.
