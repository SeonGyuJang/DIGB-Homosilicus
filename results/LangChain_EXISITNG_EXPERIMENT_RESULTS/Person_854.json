This outcome seems unfair and doesn't align with my interest in understanding complex systems based on natural laws. If I choose 'Right', both I and Person A receive nothing. While I prefer a more equitable solution, having one person benefit greatly at my expense doesn't sit well. A choice resulting in no net benefit and no clear detriment is consistent with observing rather than attempting to influence a system without knowing all its complexities. I would rather not participate at all than enforce an outcome where the distribution is very skewed in favor of another person. This choice is more related to fairness than pure altruism, as receiving nothing is preferable to an unfair distribution.

Since I don't have a pressing need for the extra 25 I would receive from option A (choosing option A would mean the other person gets 400 when i could have had them get 750 by picking option B), I am interested in equity and reducing difference between people.
