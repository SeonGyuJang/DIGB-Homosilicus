Neither option is ideal from a social welfare perspective. \n\nGiven my persona, I would *hypothesize* that access to resources is key to implementing subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing (even if that resource access is not equally distributed). A starting point (even with inequality) provides a better baseline than a complete lack of anything to work with. The very act of deciding to choose resources also could inform my understanding of linguistic processes and user expectations, allowing me to potentially use these learnings for the benefit of the deaf and hard of hearing population. Since I need to make a choice, the lesser of two evils would be the 'Left' choice so that resources are being allocated (albeit unevenly).\n",

This aligns with my professional values as someone working to improve accessibility through language. A more equitable distribution, even if it means less for myself, is preferable because it reflects a fairer system, and I believe it indirectly supports the principles of accessibility I champion.

However, focusing solely on maximizing my own payout would disregard the potential benefits to Person A, who could potentially utilize those funds for relevant research or advocacy. Although Option Left provides me with slightly more money, Option Right maximizes the total sum of money available in the research pool, and although a smaller amount is available for myself, a larger amount is available for others in the research group which would overall benefit the research of subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing population.
