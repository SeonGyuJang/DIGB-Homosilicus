The core of my persona lies in advocating for the well-being of others and minimizing suffering. While option Left creates an inequality with Person A receiving 800 and myself 200, option Right effectively creates a situation where everyone loses - a total waste for both. Even though there is an inequality, the Left option brings some form of benefit to the experiment, so it seems better than nothing.",

The principle of fairness aligns with my core values as a mental health advocate, who believes in equal opportunities and well-being for all.

This discrepancy outweighs the small personal gain I'd receive from the \"Left\" option.
