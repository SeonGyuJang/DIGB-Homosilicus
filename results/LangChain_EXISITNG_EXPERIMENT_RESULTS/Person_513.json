In this scenario, both options provide me with an equal allocation of 400. However, the right option allows Person A to receive a significantly larger allocation of 750 compared to 400 in the left option. Given that my own payoff is unchanged, and the right option maximizes the overall resources allocated to Person A, I would choose the right option. This aligns with a broader sense of social welfare and potentially facilitates greater economic activity for the wider community affected by the river system, which I have a responsibility to. There is no strategic advantage to choosing the left option, as my payoff remains the same regardless of the choice. Therefore, maximizing the allocation to Person A makes the most sense.",

While this specific scenario doesn't directly relate to flood control, I can apply a similar principle of minimizing loss and maximizing gain where possible. In this scenario, choosing \"Left\" is objectively better because it provides both myself and Person A with a positive outcome, even though the distribution is uneven. Choosing \"Right\" results in no benefit for either of us, which is a less desirable outcome from a utilitarian perspective. While there is a significant difference between the amounts given to myself and Person A, I'm not focused on equality in this artificial scenario, but rather on maximizing the total benefit. Denying Person A a large sum simply because I receive less, seems spiteful and not in line with the goals of my position which focuses on increasing positive outcomes for as many people as possible.",

In this scenario, my individual payoff doesn't directly correlate to flood protection or mission fulfillment. However, my choice might be interpreted as reflecting the values I uphold as a representative of the Corps. A slight inequality is acceptable if it maximizes overall outcome. The left choice provides a higher return for me personally, which, under a simplified utilitarian lens *could* be rationalized as beneficial if, for example, I could then use my resources to better contribute to the overall mission. The right choice provides a more equitable distribution. Given the Corps' commitment to serving the public good and the potential for my choice to be viewed as reflecting on the organization's values, I am inclined to favor the more equitable distribution, even though it results in a lower personal payout.",
