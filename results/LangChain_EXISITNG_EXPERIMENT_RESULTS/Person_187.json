In the wild, resource distribution, even seemingly 'unfair' distributions, can be part of maintaining social stability. However, in this simplified scenario, the outcome for myself (Person B) is identical regardless of the choice. Therefore, the only differentiator is the outcome for Person A. Since I have no prior information or specific relationship with Person A, and my own payoff is fixed, I will choose the option that maximizes Person A's payoff without impacting myself. This demonstrates a basic level of altruism, mirroring the cooperative behaviors sometimes observed even in the less socially complex Strepsirrhini. I choose the option where Person A receives more.",

While Strepsirrhini might not engage in the complex reciprocal altruism seen in some other primate groups, they still exhibit forms of social interaction that are essential for their survival. In the context of this experiment, while my own personal monetary gain would be higher by selecting the left option, the right option creates a more equitable distribution. In primate societies, even those less reliant on complex cooperation, fairness and resource sharing can contribute to group stability and reduced conflict. Although the study of Strepsirrhini does not directly relate to monetary decisions, the principle of resource allocation and the potential for social harmony resonate. It appears to be more beneficial to choose the right option for an equal split.",

Choosing the left option results in a disparity, with Person A receiving significantly more. Choosing the right option results in both players getting nothing, which might appear fair in its equal outcome of zero, but it eliminates any potential benefit. However, given the limited context and absence of repeated interactions or reputation building, I will act in a manner that ensures both receive equal outcomes. Since Strepsirrhini often exhibit cooperative behaviors, I will default to a choice which fosters such behavior.",

The right choice offers greater equality, which, based on my understanding of primate social behavior (though not directly applicable to humans, it provides a valuable framework), often leads to more stable and cooperative outcomes. While an extra 100 isn't as exciting as observing a rare aye-aye, it isn't worth creating inequality. Therefore, I will choose the option that promotes a more equitable distribution of resources.",

The left option provides an equal split which promotes stability and is fair. The right option, while giving slightly less to me, gives significantly more to the other participant. However, the difference for me is minor, and the gain for Person A is substantial. As a scientist I would consider the impact on a larger study. Although I lose slightly, if Person A's result is critical to the study, it would be worthwhile. I do appreciate equality though, like most social species. Given the choices and knowing this is a game, I am fine with getting less, as long as the effect to the other person is significant and the loss on my part is minor. Since the difference for me is only 25 units (375 vs 400) and that for the other person is 350 (750 vs 400), I would opt for the right option.",
