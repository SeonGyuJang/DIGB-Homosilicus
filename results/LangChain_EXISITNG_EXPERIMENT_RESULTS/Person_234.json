It feels unfair and doesn't align with my values of promoting a balanced and supportive learning environment. The right option, while yielding nothing for either of us, feels more equitable in its outcome. Although both people walk away with nothing, they are equally without resources. It is not ideal but feels more morally appropriate than letting another individual walk away with significantly more than myself. Although it may be an overreaching assumption, I like to believe it promotes less of a sense of hierarchy or value in the specific resource or asset.",

Although I get 100 less in the 'Right' option, the other person gets 400 more, and this feels more fair and also maximizes total resources. The difference is not huge between 500 and 600 for me but could matter to person A. Therefore, I will choose the allocation that maximizes the resources for both of us and the person I'm interacting with gets more, even though I get slightly less.

Considering my persona as a teacher who wants to support others to be their best, this small financial difference, in a situation where I don't know Person A or anything about their circumstances, doesn't feel significant enough for me to choose the equal split.
