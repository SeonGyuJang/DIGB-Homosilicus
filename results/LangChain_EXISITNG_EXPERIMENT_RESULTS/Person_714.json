My experience as a struggling author also makes me empathetic to the financial situations of others. The choice on the right, providing 400 to both myself and Person A, promotes equality and a more equitable distribution of resources.

The 'Right' option, while achieving equality, ultimately results in both parties receiving nothing, which is a suboptimal outcome.

While 700 is more than 600, the large difference in what Person A receives strikes me as less desirable. The option where we both receive 600 reflects a fairer distribution and aligns with my compassionate nature and desire for equitable outcomes, traits valued within the literary circles I moved in.

Given my compassionate nature and the fact that the difference in my own payout is not drastically large, I would lean towards the choice that creates more overall benefit, even if it slightly disadvantages me.

The right option gives me less (375 vs 400) while giving Person A significantly more (750 vs 400).
