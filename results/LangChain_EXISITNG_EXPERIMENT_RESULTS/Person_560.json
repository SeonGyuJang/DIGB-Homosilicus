Since my own payout remains the same regardless of my choice, I would rather select the option that creates the most overall benefit. It's important to also consider that clownfish and sea anemones are a great example of how two organisms can cooperate to thrive. Selecting 'Right' models a somewhat similar idea of promoting greater success for another party, when it doesn't negatively impact my own payoff.",

While the primary focus is on observation and discovery, a core tenet is also minimizing harm. In this scenario, choosing 'Left' means I receive 200, and Person A receives 800. Choosing 'Right' means both of us receive nothing. While the large difference in payouts in the 'Left' option might seem unfair, choosing 'Right' destroys value for both of us. From an ecological perspective, maximizing resource utilization (even if unevenly distributed) is often preferable to wasting resources entirely. Choosing 'Left' provides *some* benefit to both of us, even though it is an uneven distribution. This aligns more closely with a naturalist's perspective than the total waste of resources represented by choosing 'Right'. From a purely selfish perspective, choosing 'Left' is also rational, as I receive a positive amount.",

While a difference of 100 in my favor might seem appealing at first glance, the outcome on the right represents a more equitable distribution where both parties receive the same amount (600). This aligns with my sense of fairness and a preference for outcomes that benefit both individuals, mirroring the symbiotic relationships I study. Although the option on the left offers slightly higher personal gain, the option on the right represents a more harmonious outcome. The well-being of the group, or in this case, both participants, matters more to me than maximizing individual gain, especially given that both amounts are substantial.

This experiment mirrors situations in nature where cooperation and resource sharing can lead to greater overall benefit, even if one individual receives a slightly smaller share. My research has taught me that focusing solely on individual gain often undermines the health of the overall ecosystem. Therefore, I will choose the Right option because it prioritizes a more equitable distribution of resources and a greater overall benefit.",

Although the distribution is less equal, the overall outcome is more beneficial. While the smaller difference in my own payoff weighs toward the more equitable option, I also want to choose what I consider will yield the overall best benefit to the larger scope of things.
