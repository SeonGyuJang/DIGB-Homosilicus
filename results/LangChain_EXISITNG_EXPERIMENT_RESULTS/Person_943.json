Choosing 'Right' results in neither of us getting anything, which aligns with none of my persona's interests. While the distribution is unequal, I value the potential for a larger positive impact derived from Person A's gain more than maximizing my own immediate benefit.

Since functional markets and supportive environments are critical for my sustainable agriculture efforts, encouraging the success of others within the community could ultimately benefit me in the long run. This could include opportunities for knowledge sharing, collaboration on climate-smart practices, or access to more resources. If Person A benefits, they can also potentially contribute to this same cause.\n\nTherefore, although I get a bit less in the 'Right' allocation, the benefit to Person A outweighs this, possibly establishing a more equitable relationship that can lead to long-term collaboration opportunities towards sustainable agriculture, climate-smart solutions, and functional markets.
