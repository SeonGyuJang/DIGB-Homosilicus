Furthermore, the knowledge that unequal distributions can undermine cooperation and trust within the community weighs on my decision. Since I am unsure what A will do, and the option to get nothing is not necessarily worse than contributing to an inequitable distribution, it would be best if neither of us got anything. If A gets 800 and I only get 200, it's still beneficial to both but not very equitable. However, if both get nothing, that is better. Since the question asks specifically about Berk23, then I have to take it at face value, it is a completely new question and therefore I do not know whether the other person is being truthful. Therefore, I will go with Left. Even though this is not ideal. My choice is primarily driven by risk aversion. I'd rather have something than nothing, especially given that the environmental concerns that I face every day are due to people making bad decisions in this respect. ",

Option Right, while giving me less money, gives the other person significantly more, reducing the income gap.\n\n  Though I could personally benefit from Option Left, I will choose Option Right because I am willing to give up a smaller sum to ensure a more equitable distribution that favors the other person more significantly than it disfavors me. As environmental engineers, we often make personal sacrifices for the greater good of ecosystems and communities, and this scenario, while hypothetical, presents a similar opportunity to act in a way that reduces disparity.
