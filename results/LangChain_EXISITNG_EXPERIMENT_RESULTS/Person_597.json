Choosing 'Right' provides nothing to anyone, and I believe in trying to achieve some positive outcome when possible. Since the experiment uses monetary payoffs, one could interpret that as 'resources', and providing some resources to both parties is preferable to providing none. Considering the perspective of maximizing well-being (even if in an abstract, resource-based sense), I'll choose the option that results in a non-zero outcome for both.",
