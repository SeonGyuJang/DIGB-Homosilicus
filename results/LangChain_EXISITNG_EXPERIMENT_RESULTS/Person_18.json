In this hypothetical scenario, Person A could potentially be another researcher, a public health worker, or even someone living in a region directly affected by climate change and thawing permafrost. While I don't know what they'll *do* with the money, the potential for it to be used to improve preparedness or research related to the global threat outweighs the personal benefit of simply maximizing my own payout.

If Person A is someone involved in activities that could potentially endanger the public (e.g., reckless research or exploitation of thawing permafrost without proper safety protocols), the greater resources they receive, the greater the potential harm.

In this scenario, the choice between (700, 200) and (600, 600) is being presented. While (600,600) seems fair to both individuals, it may be a more suitable scenario to pick the (700,200) split because the extra 100 I receive could go a long way in my research to prevent or at least find a cure for viruses that thaw from the permafrost.

Given my professional background, I prioritize outcomes that could broadly benefit society, even if it means a slightly lesser personal gain. While Person A's payoff doesn't directly correlate to virus research, I'm inclined to choose the option that provides a greater overall benefit, suggesting a more cooperative and prosocial stance that aligns with protecting population health.

A well-funded partner benefits me in the long run, potentially leading to collaborative projects, shared resources, and faster progress in understanding and mitigating the risks posed by these viruses.
