The history of Sikkim is rich with instances where cooperation and shared sacrifice were crucial for survival and the preservation of cultural artifacts like the relics of Tolung Monastery. While receiving 800 feels individually beneficial, I believe the option where both players receive 400 demonstrates a commitment to fairness and a shared positive outcome.

Choosing 'Left' results in me getting 200 and the other person getting 800. While it would be preferable to have a more equitable distribution, the fact that at least *something* is being gained feels important. In a real-world scenario, a similar logic might apply where a historical preservation effort, for example, could bring different levels of benefits to different people, but some benefit is still better than none. I am willing to tolerate the inequality in hopes that there is at least some benefit.\n\nTherefore, considering the historical context and my role as a historian valuing even small gains for others while acknowledging that ideally there would be an equal distribution, I choose the left option.",
