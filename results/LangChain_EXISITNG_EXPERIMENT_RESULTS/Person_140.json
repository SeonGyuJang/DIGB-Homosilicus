Since the experiment is presumably about understanding social preferences, choosing the option that yields a better outcome for the *system* seems more aligned with a scientific mindset focused on optimal solutions.

From a purely utilitarian standpoint, the 'Left' choice maximizes the total amount of points (800 vs. 800). However, as solar power and its deployment are inherently tied to concepts of benefiting society and providing wider access to resources, I feel that the fairer distribution of resources in 'Right' aligns better with the underlying principles of my work. While I could use the larger reward to fund potentially relevant research, the disparity in outcome is difficult to ignore. Therefore, I will choose the 'Right' option to split the reward equally.",

Option Right better embodies the principles of social responsibility and fairness, even if it means slightly less personal gain.
