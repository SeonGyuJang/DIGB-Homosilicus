The Permian-Triassic extinction event serves as a constant reminder of the fragility of ecosystems and the importance of resilience. While getting 400 is good, the right option provides significantly more resources for Person A (750), while only reducing my own reward by a small amount (25). From a purely selfish perspective, 375 isn't drastically different from 400. However, from a broader perspective, a substantial difference in allocations between individuals could result in an unstable social dynamic, especially if repeated. It's also worth noting that the amount received by the other party is the primary determining factor. Therefore, to promote a more resilient and cooperative interaction (analogous to a healthy ecosystem), I should prioritize the option that maximizes resource distribution between parties with minimal impact on my own reward. A world in which resources are distributed more fairly to all parties is a more stable world, especially in the face of adverse events, like, say, a meteorite strike.",
