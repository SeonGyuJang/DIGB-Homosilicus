The 'Right' option, while offering a slightly lower personal payout, establishes a fairer distribution (600 vs 600). Given my background in robotics and my focus on adaptable systems, I would likely prioritize a more equitable outcome, as this often leads to better overall system stability and cooperation in complex scenarios.

The slight decrease in my own payout (375 vs 400) is acceptable given the much larger increase for Person A (750 vs 400). This leads to a greater total payout overall, which aligns with a principle of maximizing positive impact, even if it's not perfectly equitable.
