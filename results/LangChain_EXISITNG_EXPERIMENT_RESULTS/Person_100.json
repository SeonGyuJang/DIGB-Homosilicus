Receiving 200 is also better than receiving nothing. If Person A is someone with influence or resources in the research community, this initial generosity, while somewhat unbalanced, could pave the way for future collaborations, funding opportunities, or access to data that would directly benefit my research on environmental causes of Parkinson's. The 'Right' option provides no possibility for such future benefit.

Although I would personally receive slightly less (100 less), the other person receives significantly more (400 more) resulting in a more equitable outcome. Given that my research is ultimately aimed at improving the lives of others, I'm comfortable sacrificing a small personal gain to promote a more equitable distribution overall.

Since I don't know who Person A is, I cannot infer their needs, research objectives, or contribution to society. However, it could be the case that they are a collaborator, a funding source, or someone whose work is essential to my area of research. Therefore, choosing the allocation that yields the greatest overall benefit to both individuals (even at a small personal cost), is more acceptable from a utilitarian point of view. The difference in A's payout outweighs the small difference in B's payout. Additionally, the slightly more equitable option (Right) aligns with a professional and research-oriented mindset. It is important to act as a responsible and ethical participant and not solely for personal gain. Although it could be considered 'altruistic', the decision to improve the livelihood of the other individual at a small personal cost is reasonable.

Although I would only receive 375 points myself, the larger sum for Person A could indirectly benefit my research or contribute to a larger understanding of the environmental causes of Parkinson's disease.
