Choosing the left option also aligns with my professional values of promoting positive social relationships and reducing potential sources of conflict or resentment, which are critical for a safe and supportive school environment.

Option Right, while giving me slightly less, provides significantly more to Person A. Given my focus on fostering a positive and equitable environment, and the fact that the difference for me is relatively small (100), I will choose the option that benefits Person A much more, which is an increase of 400.

A more equitable distribution, especially if dealing with children/adolescents, aligns with my values as someone dedicated to fairness and preventing harm (even indirect harm from perceived unfairness).
