While I don't have a specific stake in Person A's outcome, I see no reason to choose the option that results in a lower payout for them. Choosing the Right option leads to a greater overall outcome, benefiting Person A without costing me anything. This aligns with a general principle of preferring pareto improvements (where one party is made better off without making another worse off).\n\nI am not motivated by spite or envy, and maximizing my own payout isn't an issue since both options do that equally well.

Option Right, while providing me with less, demonstrates a concern for the well-being of Person A, which aligns with the principles of responsible resource management and equitable distribution that are important considerations in land reclamation projects. \n\nGiven my interest in the social impacts of reclamation, and a general preference for balanced outcomes, I lean towards Option Right.
