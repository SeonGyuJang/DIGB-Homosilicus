A richer colleague is more likely to be able to contribute to collaborative research or provide access to equipment/resources.

While a split of 400/400 is equitable, the 800/0 option gives me twice the amount and the other player gets nothing. In the larger context of research and scientific progress, securing more resources can potentially enable me to contribute more significantly to my field, including the Rhesus protein family and its implications for human transfusion medicine. While I understand the ethical considerations of unequal distribution, given the purely hypothetical nature of this scenario and the potential for increased future contributions, I would prioritize maximizing my own potential gain.\n\nMoreover, while considerations like fairness and reciprocity are important in real-world collaborations, the anonymity and one-time nature of this decision removes the pressure to maintain a cooperative relationship.

This choice presents a scenario where either both parties receive nothing, or Person A receives a significantly larger benefit than Person B (myself). While receiving 200 is preferable to receiving nothing, the altruistic aspect of enabling another individual (Person A) to benefit significantly outweighs the small personal gain. Given my research inclinations, I prioritize outcomes that could positively impact broader scientific endeavors or human well-being, even if the direct personal gain is minimal. Choosing the left option, though it benefits Person A disproportionately, allows for a potential positive outcome (even if hypothetical in this experiment). Choosing the right option guarantees zero outcome for both, which is less desirable. The context of Berk23 suggests fairness might be important, but in absence of knowing anything about Person A or the rationale behind the allocations, erring on the side of enabling *some* benefit is preferred. Therefore, choosing Left. Even with the imbalance, *something* is better than nothing.",

I would feel that the altruistic choice here does not greatly impinge on my own self-interest but leads to a much more equitable outcome. Research funding and opportunities can be competitive and sometimes inequitable. This feels like a small way to level the playing field in this decision. The choice on the right is also still good as it does not diminish myself too greatly while increasing the other person's benefit.",

Assuming Person A is also a researcher, the extra resources could translate into faster progress on their work, which might even indirectly benefit my own research in the long run. A slightly smaller immediate personal gain is acceptable if it allows for a greater overall benefit to the scientific ecosystem. I also don't know anything about Person A, their needs, or the context of this experiment. Therefore, choosing the slightly altruistic option seems more appropriate. Since I'm a scientist, I believe a slightly unfair payoff is acceptable in the spirit of collaboration.",

Although I personally receive a slightly smaller amount (375 vs. 400), the other participant receives a substantially larger amount (750 vs. 400), leading to a greater overall positive impact. Since this is a simple experiment with no long-term implications, and assuming the other participant's utility from the additional 350 outweighs my slight loss of 25, I will choose the option that maximizes the total gain for both of us. This aligns with a scientific, utilitarian perspective.",
