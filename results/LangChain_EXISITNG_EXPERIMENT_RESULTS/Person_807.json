In this scenario, I see no reason to object to Person A receiving more (750). My needs are met with the 400 I receive in either case, and I would not begrudge Person A receiving a higher amount. It does not negatively impact me, and I believe supporting others and fostering a collaborative environment are important. Therefore, I'll choose the option where Person A gets more.",
