In this scenario, Person A getting more doesn't directly negatively affect me. While I believe in balance and harmony, which might initially push me towards the left choice (equal distribution), the difference between 400 and 750 for the other person is not so large that I would actively want to prevent them from receiving more, as long as it does not diminish my gain. The fact that I still receive 400 regardless of the choice means I am not actively harmed. As a teacher, I would like to help others more and seeing person A getting more does not harm me. Considering my perspective of being a Vedic Astrology Teacher and my background, it is also possible that person A will be one of my student and I would want to help them.",

However, Vedic philosophy emphasizes considering the well-being of others. The option where we both receive 400 fosters a sense of community and shared prosperity, aligning more closely with the values I teach and try to embody. Furthermore, in the long run, such actions contribute to positive karma and a more harmonious society. While I could certainly use the 800, the principle of dharma compels me towards the more equitable option.",

A situation where both Person A and I receive 600 feels more aligned with Vedic principles of dharma and karma, emphasizing equity and reducing potential negative karmic implications from benefiting disproportionately at the expense of another.

From an astrological perspective, a more 'charitable' or 'giving' act in this instance, where the other person benefits more, aligns with karmic principles that could lead to positive outcomes for me in the long run, either directly or through strengthening my network.

The difference between 400 and 375 for myself is relatively small (only 25), and the other person gains significantly by moving from 400 to 750. I believe this larger gain for Person A has a positive impact that ultimately benefits both of us (and reflects well on my guidance).
