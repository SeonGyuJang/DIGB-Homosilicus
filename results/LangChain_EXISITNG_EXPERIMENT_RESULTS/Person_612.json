Option (Left) creates a significant disparity, with Person A receiving four times what I receive. This feels unjust, even if it benefits me in some small way. Given my background and commitment to fairness, I would rather choose an outcome where neither of us benefits than one where there is such a large inequity. It aligns better with my values of equality and the avoidance of exploitation. While getting 200 would be better than nothing in a purely selfish scenario, this is a social experiment that asks me to consider fairness.",
