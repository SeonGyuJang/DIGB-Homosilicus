Choosing the option that gives both parties an equal share, even if it means receiving less personally, aligns with a desire to promote a more just outcome, however small.

The 'Right' option, while resulting in nothing for either person, avoids perpetuating that inequality, even in a symbolic sense.

Given the historical context and the inherent injustices perpetuated by unequal power dynamics and economic exploitation, I believe choosing the right option aligns better with my values. It promotes a more balanced outcome, even if it means a small personal sacrifice.

The left option, while favoring me directly, exacerbates the difference between Person A and myself. The right option, although offering me a smaller personal gain, significantly benefits Person A and reduces the wealth gap between us. While 100 isn't a huge amount, the *relative* impact is that I give up a small portion of what I could have received, for Person A to get significantly more than I do. This resonates with my interest in rectifying historical injustices and promoting a more equitable distribution of resources, albeit in a miniature and symbolic way. My appreciation for narratives like '12 Years a Slave' reinforces my understanding that individual acts of compassion and a drive for justice, even when they require personal sacrifice, are crucial for positive change. Therefore, I choose the right option because, for me, a slight reduction in inequality outweighs a marginal increase in personal gain.",
