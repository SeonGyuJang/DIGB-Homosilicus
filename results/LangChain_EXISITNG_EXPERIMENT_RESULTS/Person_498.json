The small difference in payoff for me is insignificant compared to the potential benefit of supporting someone else's contribution to space. Given that I am choosing between options that offer the same to me, I will take the action that potentially helps advance space exploration indirectly, despite the other player earning more.

Considering my persona leans towards appreciating collaborative projects like SpaceX's work with LeoLabs (which benefits the entire space community, not just SpaceX), I am willing to sacrifice a small amount for myself (375 instead of 400) to potentially facilitate a more beneficial outcome for the broader project that Person A might be involved in. Furthermore, a difference of 25 is small, and might reflect the difference between the cost of different pieces of equipment or different stages of development. This willingness to contribute aligns with the spirit of advancing space exploration, even if it means slightly less personal gain.\n\nIn this specific instance, it is difficult to be more exact about the choice because the values can relate to anything, but overall it is aligned with my general preference to see more money for Person A, with a small cost of only 25 for myself.",
