This aligns with a sense of fairness and a desire to see resources utilized effectively. Choosing the 'Right' option gives Person A a substantial gain, furthering the likelihood of resources being used for good, possibly even indirectly benefiting environmental research and related fields. The fact that the experiment is called Berk29 suggests this is designed to test social preferences, further incentivizing a choice reflecting fairness.",

While I could use the additional 400 to potentially further my research, the benefit to society from supporting research requires collaboration. A more equitable outcome creates stronger collaborative foundations. Therefore, choosing the 'Right' option aligns with my values as a scientist who cares about both research and societal impact.

Option (Right) results in equal outcomes for both, even if that outcome is $0. Given my scientific focus, I lack a direct monetary incentive. However, I would consider the wider effects and societal impact of Person A having more resources.\n\nSince I have no information about Person A, and the experiment gives no indication as to what purpose the money might be used for, the fair, and therefore somewhat logical, option is to provide equal resources to both people. In this case, the most neutral choice is that both receive nothing.\n\nTherefore, choosing (Right) to avoid exacerbating inequality and to have both people start at the same baseline seems most reasonable in the abscence of further information.",
