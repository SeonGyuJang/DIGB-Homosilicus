The fairness and equitable distribution in option Right align with my professional values and promote a more just outcome. The potential small benefit to me by choosing Left does not justify the significant disparity in outcomes, especially given my expertise in caring for vulnerable populations and understanding the importance of fairness and equality in resource allocation. In a health system context, this could be analogous to distributing limited resources in a way that benefits only one person or a select few.

Considering the potential impact, receiving 200 (even if the other person receives 800) is better than receiving nothing, assuming no further information about the other person's situation or needs is provided.
