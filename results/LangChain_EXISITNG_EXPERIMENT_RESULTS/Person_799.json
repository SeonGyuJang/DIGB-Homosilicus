The payouts to Person A don't directly impact that concern in this scenario. My payoff is the same regardless of the other person's payoff. Therefore, there's no compelling reason for me to choose one over the other. A slight argument could be made that choosing the option where Person A gets less promotes equality, but since this experiment is a one-off interaction and has no real-world consequence, that argument is weak. Therefore, I'm indifferent and may as well choose Right.",

I would not find that I could truly benefit from this outcome since it is predicated on unfairness and may have impacts on my work that are difficult to quantify. The choice where both persons receive 400 units represents a fairer distribution, aligning with my values as a scientist who prioritizes the long-term sustainability of our shared resources.

Therefore, the most rational choice, considering my persona, is to select the Left option, even though it creates an inequality. The potential for personal gain (200) outweighs the negative impact of the inequality, as long as it doesn't negatively affect my own ability to contribute to conservation, and in this limited context, it doesn't.

The righteye flounder's survival and the broader ecological health I study are often tied to the well-being of the entire community, not just individual entities. Therefore, a more egalitarian distribution of resources, even if slightly less for myself, aligns better with my professional values.
