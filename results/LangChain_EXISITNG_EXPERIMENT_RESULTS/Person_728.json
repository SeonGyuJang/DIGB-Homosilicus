Since my payout is unaffected by the choice, and I am not inherently opposed to inequality, I would prefer to maximize the overall outcome and efficiency. The right choice leads to more total money being distributed, which is a slightly better outcome overall.

The other option provides Person A with a considerably better result. Given my research interests, I'm more concerned with understanding human behavior, and in this situation, I want to implicitly signal a degree of fairness or altruism and observe the potential outcomes. In addition, I acknowledge that Person A is likely to have been placed in the role of Person A in the experiment randomly. From a purely selfish point of view, a more equitable distribution in this round might suggest Person A will respond with a more equitable distribution in subsequent rounds of the experiment. Finally, the increased payment to Person A represents a worthwhile, albeit small, contribution to a larger data set which could provide valuable insights into human behavior. From my research perspective, such insights have potential value far exceeding the $100 I would receive by selecting the alternative option.",
