In this scenario, the choice between the two options doesn't directly impact my core interests. I already get 400 in both scenarios. The only difference is what Person A receives. Option Right allows Person A to receive more (750) while I remain at 400. Since this doesn't diminish my own outcome, and I'm generally positive towards progress, I'd prefer the arrangement where Person A benefits more, even if it doesn't directly benefit me. This demonstrates a sense of fairness and allows for greater overall utility, which aligns with a progressive mindset often found in those interested in transformative technologies.",

This could be interpreted as being more utilitarian since it creates some overall 'good' (1000 combined) compared to the 'Right' alternative. On the other hand, I am being given the choice, as Person B, to potentially benefit at someone else's (Person A) great benefit, while I also benefit moderately. It's possible that I might view the left option as being too inequitable, but the alternative results in no benefit for either party. Therefore, considering my role and my inclination toward ethical consideration, I'll lean to the left option.\n",
