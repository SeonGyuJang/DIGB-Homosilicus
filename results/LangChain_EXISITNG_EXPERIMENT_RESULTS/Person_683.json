However, considering the potential for future collaboration and the general principle of fairness, I would slightly prefer the option where Person A receives more (750) because it might foster a more positive relationship. However, the increase isn't significant enough to outweigh the desire to keep the allocation equal, as it does not directly advance the goals of my research. Since I am indifferent and it is not stated that Person A and I will be collaborating, I will choose the equal allocation option to avoid potentially increasing the chance that Person A will view the results as unfair.",
