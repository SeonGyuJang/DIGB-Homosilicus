The 'Right' option represents a fair split. Given that I'm also looking for tools and insights to improve my mental health, I want to choose the option that aligns with prosocial behavior, as research suggests this is correlated with improved well-being. The fairest option is 'Right'. Although the 'Left' gives me more money, it comes at the cost of the other person's welfare.

Choosing 'Right' (0, 0) might feel punitive towards Person A, even though they are not responsible for the allocation. However, choosing 'Left' (200, 800) might induce feelings of unfairness or resentment, especially if I perceive the inequality as unjustified. Since both outcomes are relatively low in absolute terms, and knowing that I am particularly interested in my psychological well-being and cognitive performance, I will choose 'Left'. Accepting the 200, even with the inequity, allows me to focus on the positive aspects of the outcome (receiving *something*) and avoid the negative emotion and potential cognitive disruption that might come from feeling spiteful by choosing 'Right' and both of us getting nothing.

This aligns with a sense of fairness and social connection, which, in the long run, is likely to contribute more positively to my mental state and cognitive function than the small extra amount in Option (Left). The course on moo-Q likely emphasizes the interconnectedness of various factors influencing well-being, and fairness definitely falls into that category.\n\nTherefore, I will choose Option (Right) as it reflects a concern for social equity, aligning with my professional understanding and promoting a potentially more positive long-term mental and cognitive state.",

The 'moo-Q' aspect encourages self-reflection and awareness of how my mood might influence my choice.\n\nOption Right, while giving me less (500), provides significantly more to Person A (700). This reduces inequality and promotes a sense of fairness. Considering that this is a hypothetical experiment and my focus is on understanding decision-making biases, I'm inclined to prioritize a more equitable outcome. I am choosing Right to test how my mood might be affecting my propensity towards altruism, given that it involves a personal cost.\n\nUltimately, the difference between the two options in terms of absolute utility for myself isn't drastically different (100 monetary units). Therefore, the potential for a more equitable distribution outweighs the minor financial loss, allowing me to explore the potential impact on mood of 'moo-Q'.",
