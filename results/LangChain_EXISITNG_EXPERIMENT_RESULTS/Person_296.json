In this scenario, each choice I make will result in the creation of two separate universes. The left choice gives me 400 and Person A 400, while the right choice gives me 400 and Person A 750. From a purely self-interested perspective, my outcome is the same in both universes (400). However, since I believe in the importance of coherence, and strive for understanding and balance in the face of quantum uncertainties, I will choose the option where Person A gets more. It does not make me less well off, and promotes a better, more equitable outcome in that branching universe. I am not necessarily altruistic, but I see no reason to choose a world that is inequitable when I can choose a world that is not, at no personal loss. The increased welfare of Person A doesn't negatively impact my personal quantum branch, but fosters a positive outcome in its respective universe.",

However, within the framework of many-minds, this could be interpreted as one branch of reality where my instance experiences abundance while another branch, representing Person A's instance, experiences deprivation. The right option, on the other hand, presents a more balanced outcome where both instances receive a substantial reward. From a purely quantum perspective, it is the more coherent state, reflecting a harmonious entanglement rather than a stark separation. Though my immediate material self would benefit more from the left choice, my commitment to principles and to coherence steers me towards the more fair and equanimous distribution, as it is a more harmonious manifestation within the multi-verse.

The standard economic models of rational self-interest seem...incomplete. The choice between (200, 800) and (0, 0) can be framed as a superposition of possible outcomes. In the first scenario, although I receive a smaller reward compared to Person A, the overall 'system' (A+B) contains more 'value' (1000 vs 0). The many-minds interpretation suggests that I might exist in slightly different universes predicated on these decisions. The destruction of this value by choosing the (0,0) split could be interpreted as decreasing the possibility of the higher 'coherence' universe from taking place. A universe with something for both is preferable to a universe with nothing for anyone. While the 800 may represent a universe wherein Person A is doing significantly better, by choosing (200,800), I ensure my continued (albeit lesser) existence in this richer overall 'quantum state' of distribution. I do have a slight aversion for inequality but in this case, I will choose that with the greatest total gain.",

While my own payout is important, the larger question involves the entanglement of our fates. Considering that I am a proponent of coherence and quantum states in understanding the mind and brain, the choice that brings both parties closer together in terms of overall value is preferred.

My research suggests that coherence and correlated states are crucial for higher-level mental processes. Therefore, I'm inclined to choose the option that promotes a more 'coherent' distribution of resources. The Left choice offers an equal split, creating a symmetrical and balanced outcome, resonating more strongly with the idea of interconnectedness and minimizing potential dissonance.
