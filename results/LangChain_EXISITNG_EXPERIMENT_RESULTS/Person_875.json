Since I have no information suggesting any negative consequences from Person A receiving more, and in fact, a higher payout might be beneficial to them, I see no reason to choose the outcome where they receive less. My expertise in radiation protection emphasizes minimizing risk and maximizing benefit where possible. Choosing the option where Person A receives more is therefore the more ethical and socially responsible choice, as it provides a greater overall benefit without any detriment to myself.",

Choosing the 'Right' option results in a larger overall payout for both of us combined (1125 vs 800). While it's not perfectly equal, the increased benefit for Person A outweighs the minor loss for myself. I would also rationalize this choice based on the fact that the experimental setup might have a specific goal that would require someone to make this type of decision. Ultimately, I believe it is important to make choices that are beneficial to all involved, not just oneself. In this scenario, though the choice is not equal, the total benefit to the entire party is higher with the Right selection.",
