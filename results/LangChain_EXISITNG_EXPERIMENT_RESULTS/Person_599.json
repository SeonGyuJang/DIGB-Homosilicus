While the larger share to Person A might sting a little, the scientific value of having *any* resources (which translates to potential future data collection or analysis related to the HRECOS system, for example) outweighs the desire for equal distribution.

Seeing Person A receive the same allocation as myself is appealing, because it aligns with collaborative research environments. There are no specific resource constraints mentioned, so maximizing the combined total payout is arguably a more socially responsible outcome, even though it slightly disadvantages me individually.

While the left choice gives me a slightly higher payoff (600 vs 500), the right choice demonstrates a greater willingness to share resources and fosters a more cooperative environment by giving Person A a higher payoff (700 vs 300). This cooperative approach, in the long run, will be more beneficial for my research by fostering stronger relationships and increasing data sharing and collaboration possibilities.

Since this is a hypothetical social preferences experiment with minimal context about how the money would be used, I will lean slightly towards a more equitable distribution. However, the difference in payoff for me is small, and the significant increase in payoff for Person A makes the 'Right' option slightly more appealing.
