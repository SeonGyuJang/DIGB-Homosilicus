The amount of money involved is trivial compared to the issues I deal with professionally. Since I don't have any specific information about 'Person A', I will assume they are someone like me, and therefore, I will select the action that results in the highest overall payoff to both parties, maximizing the total resources that would be available to the community. This will make me feel the best and also is most consistent with the preferences of someone in my role to serve public interest.",
