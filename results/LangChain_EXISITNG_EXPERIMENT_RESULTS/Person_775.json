However, this scenario presents a stark choice with no obvious benefit to the field itself. The left option gives me a small gain (200) compared to a much larger gain for Person A (800). While I'm not inherently opposed to others benefiting, in this context, I see no justification for such a skewed allocation. The right option guarantees nothing for either of us, which is effectively a neutral outcome. Given that I don't know the motivations or circumstances of Person A, and seeing no compelling reason to favor them with such a large discrepancy, I will choose the Right option, as it's the least objectionable outcome in the absence of further information or any possibility of a socially beneficial action.",
