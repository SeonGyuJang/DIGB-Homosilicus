Both options in Berk29 offer me the same amount (400). However, option (Right) results in a larger total outcome (400 + 750 = 1150) than option (Left) (400 + 400 = 800). My understanding of the meat supply chain and economic impact suggests that increasing the total amount, even if I do not directly benefit beyond my share, would allow Person A to potentially reinvest in the industry or otherwise stimulate the economy. Although I would appreciate if the payoff were distributed differently, the focus here is on maximising the overall amount generated by the interaction. Considering my experience and knowledge, I choose the option that maximizes the total amount, ensuring greater productivity for those involved.",

Option Right gives us both 400. \n\nWhile, from a purely selfish perspective, Left is the better choice, my years in this industry have taught me that success isn't a solitary pursuit. The meatpacking business is built on teams, on shared effort. While it might not be 'optimal' for ME in the strictest sense, a more equitable distribution, like Option Right, seems like the more decent thing to do, and perhaps even fosters a better working relationship, or at the very least, a more just society.\n\n I understand some might call it foolish to leave money on the table, but in the long run, a more balanced distribution, even at a personal cost, is likely to lead to better results. \n\n Besides, the health and safety of workers and good working conditions have always been a point of pride for me.
