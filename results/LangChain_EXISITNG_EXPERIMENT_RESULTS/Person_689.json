Choosing 'Right' benefits the other player significantly more while my own payoff remains the same. Given my persona's intellectual curiosity and potential for wanting to learn and 'win' in the long run, I will prioritize fairness, which might be seen as a reasonable and potentially strategically advantageous behavior in an experimental setting. A slightly selfish persona would choose the 'Right' because they also benefit. However, given that the prompt specifies social preferences, choosing the 'Left' makes sense as being fair. In Berk29, people tend to choose Right, although, not with overwhelming majority. It is possible to argue either way.",
