The discovery of America and resulting economic changes have already increased inequality and could lead to social instability. \n\nThe left option offers an equal distribution (400, 400).

Therefore, while it means sacrificing some immediate gain, this choice is more aligned with my broader vision and the long-term stability of the modern state.
