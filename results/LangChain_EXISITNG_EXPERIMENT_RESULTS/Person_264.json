Person B (representing, perhaps, US agricultural exporters) receives 200, which could represent increased revenue or access to vital resources. While I personally get more if Person A gets zero, my professional interest is in fostering mutually beneficial trade. Shutting down any potential gain for the other player is detrimental to the goal of informing policies that meet the needs of both U.S. agricultural exporters and importers.

This disparity could be seen as unfair and might not foster the kind of cooperative environment that benefits trade relationships in the long run. Considering the importance of fair trade practices and building strong relationships with trading partners, I would lean towards a more equitable outcome.
