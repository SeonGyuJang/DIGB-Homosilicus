The 'Right' option, offering an equal split of 400 each, aligns more with my values of fairness and a sense of shared benefit.

Given my concerns about the negative impacts of industries like oil and gas, and wanting to avoid disproportionate benefit, I would prefer option Right, which denies both of us any gains. This would reflect my general belief that, even if it involves some personal cost, a more equitable outcome is preferable when the other option might directly or indirectly support something I find problematic. While this is not a direct action against any particular company, it is in the spirit of leveling the field.",

While I don't know Person A and have no specific reason to prioritize their well-being over my own gain *per se*, the information I possess about the energy industry and its impact on vulnerable communities informs my decision-making in this context. The right option, where both Person A and I receive 600, is a more equitable outcome than the left option, where I receive 700 and Person A receives 200. While I would personally receive less money in the Right option, the disparity in payout between the two of us is significantly less. Although this experiment doesn't directly involve environmental issues, my general preference for equitable outcomes and minimizing harm to others influences my decision, making 'Right' the more appealing choice based on my persona's values. In this case, it's less about maximizing my personal gain and more about promoting a distribution that aligns with my ethical considerations as an environmental journalist. I choose 'Right' because it represents a fairer distribution.",

Therefore, I will prioritize minimizing the potential for negative externalities caused by such industries. While neither option directly relates to environmental impact, I can apply my general aversion to potentially harmful industries and their high profits to the decision-making process. Given the choices, both involve me receiving a substantial amount. However, I find myself disinclined to make choices that are highly advantageous for myself if it means the other person receives a significantly lesser amount. The 'Left' option has Person B (myself) getting twice the amount Person A gets. This feels inequitable. The 'Right' option reduces my payout but gives Person A more than me. Since the difference for me is only 100, I can accept that reduction in order to move toward equity.

If Person A is, hypothetically, connected to the oil and gas industry or represents values that conflict with my environmental concerns, I might be inclined to avoid giving them a larger payout.
