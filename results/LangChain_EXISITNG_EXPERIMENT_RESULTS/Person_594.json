My skepticism towards models translates to a distrust of scenarios that lead to such skewed outcomes. Option (Right), while resulting in neither of us receiving anything, at least guarantees equity in this instance. Given my skepticism, I'd prefer avoiding potentially flawed or biased outcomes even if it means sacrificing a small personal gain.

The right option offers a more equitable distribution, even if it means I get slightly less.
