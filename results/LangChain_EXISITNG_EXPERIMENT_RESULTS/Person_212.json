My research emphasizes the importance of reducing negative emotional responses, and choosing an option that seems unfair could induce feelings of resentment, which I want to avoid in my own life and potentially study. Additionally, from a research perspective, a more equitable distribution might foster a more cooperative and trusting relationship, which could be valuable if these decisions were related to future collaborative opportunities (though it is implied they are not). Therefore, I will choose the option that provides an equal payoff for both of us, as it aligns with my values of fairness and avoiding unnecessary emotional arousal.",

My research focuses on mitigating these negative emotional and physiological cascades. Choosing the option where both receive a fair amount (400 each) aligns with my professional interest in promoting well-being and reducing stress.

While the outcome of the experiment may not directly induce anger, the possibility of perceived unfairness or inequity could subtly influence my physiological state. Choosing 'Right' where both individuals receive nothing eliminates any sense of unfairness or perceived inequity. This aligns with my research interest in avoiding potential physiological arousal. Even though I lose out on 200 units, the mental peace of knowing neither of us benefited unfairly might be beneficial. Also, this being a social preference experiment, the 'Left' option feels highly imbalanced and could, depending on the perspective, be seen as a disadvantageous inequity. Choosing Right feels like the fairest and least emotionally activating choice, especially considering my research interests.",

Therefore, I would prefer the option that promotes a sense of equity and minimizes the potential for feelings of resentment or injustice. Although the Left option gives me a slightly higher monetary reward, the Right option provides a much fairer distribution (600 for me and 600 for the other person). Avoiding the unfair allocation of Left might indirectly contribute to reduced stress and anger, which aligns with my research goals. Even though I would get 100 less, it's worth it to have Person A get an extra 400 to make it more equitable and reduce chances of anger/stress related problems. In that sense, the choice becomes not about personal monetary gain, but about minimizing stressors that could negatively impact cardiovascular health. For my research, it's best to select the Right choice.",
