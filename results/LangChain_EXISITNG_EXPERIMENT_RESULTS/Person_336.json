Option Right provides a more equitable distribution, with both Person A and myself receiving 600. However, the magnitude of the reward I receive outweighs the cost of the inequity in this situation. It might be possible for Person A to use the amount they get (200) to continue to benefit themselves or others, and the larger sum for myself could be used to fund research or continuing education related to helping more people with the issues I specialize in, so I choose Option Left. I also do not think that a 100 unit decrease in personal outcome is worth making a stranger gain 400 more units.",

Choosing the right option results in Person B getting $500 and Person A getting $700, which is $200 less for Person B and $400 more for person A. The right option results in a larger combined payout and a more equitable split.
