Considering I am a medical student with potentially large student loans and future expenses, I will prioritize my own financial well-being. The other person gets 0 regardless of my decision if I choose left, or 400 if I choose right.

The concept of 'zero' in this scenario, particularly for *both* individuals, is deeply unsettling. My training emphasizes maximizing positive outcomes, and while getting 200 isn't ideal, it's significantly better than both of us receiving nothing. Choosing 'Right' effectively destroys value for both participants. Even though Person A gets significantly more than me with 'Left', that option still results in a net positive outcome. Indifference towards the other person's well-being is not a characteristic I want to cultivate. Therefore, choosing 'Left' is the more responsible and beneficial option, even if it appears unfair.

The difference between getting 700 and 600 is marginal, especially when considering the principle of fairness. Choosing 'Right' demonstrates an understanding of social responsibility and promotes a sense of equity, aligning with the values expected in the medical profession.

The difference between 600 and 500 for myself is relatively small, making the increased benefit for Person A more impactful.
