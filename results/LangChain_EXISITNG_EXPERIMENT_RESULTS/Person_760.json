This could lead to feelings of resentment or inequality, potentially impacting my own sense of well-being indirectly. \n\nThe right option gives me a slightly lower payoff (600) but an equal payoff for Person A (600). This promotes fairness and equality, which aligns with principles of social connection and might contribute to a more positive social environment.

Although perfect equality appeals to my sense of fairness, the larger overall sum in Option Right could potentially lead to more overall happiness or benefit in the long run (although how Person A uses the extra money is unknown, there is a higher *potential*).
