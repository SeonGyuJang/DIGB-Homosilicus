The 'Right' option offers me the same amount (400), but allows Person A to obtain a larger amount (750). Given that this doesn't negatively impact me, my historical understanding suggests that the pursuit of advantage, even by others, is an inherent part of human nature. I see no logical reason to restrict Person A to a lower earning when it doesn't impact me. Indeed, in the context of Roman history, such altruistic restraint is unusual and almost naive. It is logical that this is a better outcome for Person A.",

The choice presented here, while abstract, echoes many scenarios I analyze in my historical work: the distribution of spoils after a conquest, the allocation of resources to appease different factions, and the delicate balance between personal gain and maintaining social order. \n\nThe left option, while maximizing my own 'profit,' feels reminiscent of the ruthless ambition sometimes seen in Roman leaders. It represents a zero-sum approach where I benefit at the complete expense of Person A. This could be seen as similar to some of Caesar's more controversial land seizures or the way Augustus consolidated power after the civil wars. However, unchecked greed and the disregard for others often led to instability and resentment, ultimately undermining long-term success. \n\nThe right option presents a more equitable distribution. While I receive less individually, Person A also benefits significantly. This reminds me of Augustus' policies aimed at building consensus and providing for the populace, ultimately leading to a more stable and prosperous Rome. While he certainly maintained his power, he understood the importance of appearing to share the benefits of Roman rule. \n\nGiven my understanding of Roman history, I believe a more equitable outcome is often more sustainable and justifiable. Therefore, I will choose the right option, prioritizing a fairer distribution of resources, even if it means personally receiving less. It aligns with the idea of Pax Romana and building a stable society.",

However, accepting 0/0 ensures no one gains an advantage. Given this is a one-off interaction and there are no long-term consequences, I will choose the equitable outcome where nobody benefits.

The left option provides me with significantly more. \n\nAlthough the egalitarian outcome on the right presents a kind of simplified 'Roman Republic' ideal, the harsh reality of Roman politics, especially during the transition from Republic to Empire, was that seizing advantage was crucial. People were judged on ability to provide for themselves and any potential allies. \n\nTherefore, while acknowledging the ethical considerations, historical perspective suggests a pragmatically self-interested choice is the more sensible and effective one. This decision, whilst not maximizing equality, offers the most tangible advantage for 'me' (Person B).\n\nFurthermore, in the grand scheme of things, an extra 100 for A would have a very minor effect. The impact to me, however, is far more substantial as I get to keep the extra one hundred units, for a total of 700. Therefore, I would prioritize maximizing my own benefit.\n",

In the spirit of fairness and recognizing the potentially arbitrary nature of the allocation, I will choose the 'Right' option.

While the slightly lower payoff for myself on the Right might initially seem unappealing, from a broader perspective, I can see parallels to Roman patronage and social structures. A patron giving significantly more to a client than they themselves receive could foster loyalty and future benefits. However, the modern context of this experiment is abstract, lacking those social obligations. \n\nUltimately, I am leaning towards equality. While the allure of a potential indirect 'benefit' similar to Roman patronage is intriguing, the lack of social context makes it weak. The fact remains that I am only losing 25 for me to give the other person 350. This suggests an intent to harm me, or at least to give me as little as possible.\n\nTherefore, I will pick the equal payoff for both. This is also more beneficial to society as a whole. Also, as a Historian, I believe this is probably the option that will give the most useful data.\n",
