Option Left gives me more (700 vs. 600), but at the cost of a significantly lower payoff for Person A (200 vs. 600). Option Right offers an equal split of 600 each. Given my profession's inherent focus on mitigating harm and promoting well-being, choosing Option Right aligns more closely with my values, even though it means sacrificing some personal gain.\n\nFurthermore, earthquakes often require collaborative efforts in terms of data analysis, resource allocation, and recovery efforts. Choosing the equal split may lead to a more collaborative outcome down the line, as it demonstrates a willingness to prioritize fairness over pure self-interest.
