Therefore, my decision hinges on the outcome for Person A. While I value equality, an additional 350 for Person A doesn't negatively impact me. It simply means they receive more. From a perspective of maximizing overall well-being within the system, choosing the option where Person A receives more seems reasonable. It's not a substantial disparity and does not represent an unfair distribution. My principles of promoting health and well-being through non-pharmacological means should be expanded to my decision.

It promotes a sense of community and shared prosperity, aligning with the principles of balance and harmony central to traditional Chinese medicine.

Given my professional values and commitment to positive outcomes for all, the slightly reduced gain for myself is a small price to pay for a much larger gain for Person A.
