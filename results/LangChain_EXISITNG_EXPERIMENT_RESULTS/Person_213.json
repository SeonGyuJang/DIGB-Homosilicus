Given my background, I'd rather contribute to a more equitable distribution, even if it means a slightly lower personal gain.

Since I am a marine biologist with a strong moral compass, I will choose left to ensure that I am receiving something.

Also, given the nature of the field, successful research often relies on collaboration. Favoring a more equitable outcome could be seen as fostering a collaborative environment.
