From a purely selfish perspective, I am indifferent. However, the small difference in the total payoff leads me to favor the option where Person A gets a slightly larger share, aligning with a preference for fairness. I am choosing to act in a way that is marginally more beneficial to the other participant. It is not about altruism, but making a choice given indifference about the payoff to myself, but a slight increase in the overall amount allocated to the other player.",

The marginal decrease in my payout seems a reasonable 'cost' for a larger reward for Person A, fostering potentially a more productive and equitable research environment (even if this is a simplified experiment). I wouldn't let financial considerations dictate my choices, especially since 500 is still a substantial amount. Thus, I choose to support the option where Person A receives more.",
