However, the difference is only 100 and sharing some reward may have positive results for collaboration in the future.

From a utilitarian perspective and considering potential future collaborations (even if unlikely), choosing the option that significantly benefits another individual, even at a slight personal cost, aligns with a principled approach. Furthermore, choosing 'Right' promotes a more equitable distribution of resources, which resonates with the broader ethical considerations that often accompany scientific advancements like genetic engineering.
