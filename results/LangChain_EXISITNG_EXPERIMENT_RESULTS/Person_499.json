Therefore, choosing 'Right' leads to a Pareto improvement and increases overall societal welfare without negatively affecting me. Since my role is to maximize overall welfare, choosing 'Right' aligns with my objectives. Even if one were solely focused on minimizing inequality, the difference in outcome would depend on Person A's current situation and would not be enough to justify the same payoff with the 'Left' option when 'Right' allows the possibility of increasing total welfare.",

A totally zero allocation, while 'fair' in terms of equality, provides no benefit whatsoever. The question is labeled 'Berk23' which gives no specific context, so I assume there is no real context. In a real-world scenario, considerations would be very different, but as it stands, maximizing total benefit, even with inequality, is preferable. This aligns with a consequentialist perspective often employed in economic policymaking where the best outcome is the one that generates the greatest good for the greatest number, even if there are uneven distributions of that good.

Given that, I would lean towards the more equitable outcome (Right), where both individuals receive 600.
