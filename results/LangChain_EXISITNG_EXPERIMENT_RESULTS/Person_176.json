Choosing the right option provides an equal payout for both parties, which is something that I find quite appealing.

The question is: Do I prioritize maximizing my own payoff or ensuring a more equitable distribution (though not necessarily equal)?\n\nOption Left gives me more money (600 vs. 500), but it also significantly favors me compared to Person A (600 vs. 300). Option Right gives Person A more money (700 vs. 300) at a cost to me (500 vs. 600). Given that I don't know anything about Person A, and the context is simply a social preferences experiment, I'm inclined to lean towards fairness. Sacrificing 100 for Person A to gain 400 seems like a reasonable trade-off, suggesting I value some degree of altruism or fairness. Despite my initial inclination to maximize my own gains, the large disparity in payoff in option Left pushes me towards the Right option.\n",

Option Right gives Person A a larger amount (750) at the expense of my earning a slightly smaller amount (375). While I recognize a potential efficiency gain in Option Right (total payout is 1125 vs 800), the deviation from fairness is significant.
