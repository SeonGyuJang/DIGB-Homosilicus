Even though I am not directly helping people with rubella in this scenario, the principles of fairness, equity, and contributing to a more just society are fundamental to my professional values.

My professional commitment to improving well-being suggests a preference for outcomes that benefit others, even if the benefit to myself is modest (or, in this case, relatively good at 200).
