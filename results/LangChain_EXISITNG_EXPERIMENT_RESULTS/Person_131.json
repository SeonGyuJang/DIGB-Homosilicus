The right option, where we both get 600, represents a more equitable and balanced outcome. This reflects my appreciation for harmony and a sense of fairness, aligning with the spirit of classical music and my admiration for Mozart's ability to create intricate and beautiful structures.

It creates a more equitable, although not perfectly equal, distribution.
