This disparity could be interpreted as unfair, and might negatively impact future interactions or collaborations, even in a hypothetical scenario. The 'Right' option provides a more equitable outcome where both Person A and I receive the same amount (600).

This scenario presents a choice between maximizing my own gain versus contributing to a higher overall outcome for the team (represented by Person A). \n\nConsidering that Person A gets significantly more in the 'Right' option, I would opt for the 'Right' option. The slight reduction in my personal gain seems a worthwhile investment in team morale and overall project success.
