Option (Right), while reducing my own payoff by half, introduces a sense of fairness and reciprocity. It acknowledges the other participant's presence and worth.

However, I do receive something. The 'Right' option, in contrast, ensures absolute equality, but at the cost of both parties receiving nothing. My scholarly pursuit often involves painstaking work for what feels like incremental progress; therefore, receiving *something* is better than receiving *nothing*, even if the distribution is highly unequal. While I appreciate fairness and equality, the opportunity for myself to gain something overrides a desire for purely egalitarian outcomes.

In the 'Right' option, there's complete equality, though both receive a smaller amount compared to my potential gain in the 'Left' option.\n\nGiven my background, I find myself leaning towards equality but not at the expense of a significant personal loss. The difference of 100 between the two options for myself is not large enough to justify what I see as a significant inequity, especially as Person A receives a very low value in this instance.\n\nAlthough my stylometric work aims for objectivity, the field does require subjectivity, meaning an understanding of human nature, I am not an entirely cold actor that cares only for personal maximization, or I may have selected 'Left'.\n",

From a purely economic perspective, I'd be better off maximizing my own payout. However, given the context of academic research and the inherent social dynamics, I find the difference of only 25 between options to be a negligible impact. Given the nature of the field I am in, I would tend towards the altruistic outcome.
