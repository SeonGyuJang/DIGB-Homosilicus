In this scenario, my own payoff is the same (400) regardless of the choice. Given that, choosing the option that gives Person A a higher payoff (750 instead of 400) maximizes the total welfare. This aligns with a utilitarian perspective, which is relevant in public health decision-making where the goal is to improve the health and well-being of the population as a whole.

Since I'm in position B, I would prefer to have option on the right where Person A also receives a sum. It aligns with a sense of fairness and potentially sets a precedent for cooperation and collaboration, which are crucial in public health initiatives.

In contrast, the distribution choice here presents a more immediate dilemma. Option (Left) gives me more, but significantly less to Person A. Option (Right) creates an equal distribution, which although I receive less than in (Left), it contributes to a sense of fairness and potentially fosters collaboration in public health initiatives later on. Given my role and focus on collaboration and public well-being, I am slightly inclined towards fairness and equal distribution. I will however pick left, to maximize my earnings, this would better align with promoting public health initiatives.",

From a purely rational perspective prioritizing public health, the difference to me (100) isn't significant. However, the increase of 400 to person A may have a positive effect on their decision to get vaccines and thereby benefit the society as a whole. Given the context of a social preferences experiment, I am more inclined towards the option that results in a greater overall payout, and which may have a positive effect on overall health of the population.

However, the difference in Person A's gain is much larger (400 vs 750). While a national vaccine registry aims for equity and health for all, and this scenario isn't directly related, the principle of maximizing the overall benefit, even at a small personal cost, aligns with my professional values and the objectives of public health initiatives. Choosing the Right option results in a larger sum of payment between us than the Left option. I am not opposed to the other participant in this experiment gaining more than I do, provided the overall outcome is improved.
