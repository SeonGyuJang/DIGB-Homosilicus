The right option offers a more equitable distribution of resources, where both Person A and I receive a substantial amount (600 each). Given the context of caring about well-being and anxiety management, I believe choosing the option that benefits both parties more equally aligns better with a desire for positive outcomes for everyone involved.

If Person A is also involved in anxiety research or treatment (which is possible, given the context of this experiment), maximizing their potential benefit could indirectly contribute to improved anxiety management strategies. While the difference in my own payout is small (only 25 points), the difference in Person A's payout is substantial (350 points).
