In this context, 'resources' could be interpreted as something tangible or simply as a positive outcome. While 800 for me might seem appealing initially, the alternative of 400 for both me and the other person aligns better with a fairness-based approach, which I believe is consistent with my role as an administrator who is responsible for the development of children at the school. Promoting fairness and equity, even in this abstract scenario, reflects the values I try to instill in the school environment. Also, as someone administering tests, I want to prevent any potential bias that would skew the results. Choosing right demonstrates my unbiased thinking.
