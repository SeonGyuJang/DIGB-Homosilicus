The allocation of resources, even hypothetical ones, should reflect a certain level of equity. In this scenario, both options provide me with the same amount (400). However, the right option gives person A a significantly larger amount (750). This creates an imbalance that, while not directly detrimental to me, feels unfair. I am more comfortable with the equal split represented by the left option, which gives both of us 400.

While my expertise often leads to advantageous positions in gem trading, this experiment tests social preferences. Option (Left) guarantees a higher payoff for me, but completely deprives Person A. Option (Right) offers a smaller personal gain but creates an equal distribution. Given my profession which involves a level of trust and fairness in appraisal, and to align with a social preference for fairness, I will choose the equal distribution, even though it's less profitable for me personally.\n\nConsidering Berk26, which focuses on fairness, it's more reasonable to split the reward equally.

The Right option, while yielding nothing immediately, avoids creating a situation where Person A receives a significantly larger share. This could potentially lead to resentment or a breakdown in trust, which could harm future interactions. In this case, I want to signal my interest in fairness and equity so that future collaborations with Person A will be more profitable. By choosing Right, I want to see how person A reacts to a fair outcome. This will allow me to choose my future collaborators more carefully.\n\nChoosing the Right option also aligns with my knowledge of Sri Lankan sapphires, where fair trade and ethical sourcing are increasingly valued.

A reputation for fairness can lead to more sustainable and profitable long-term relationships in the gemstone business.
