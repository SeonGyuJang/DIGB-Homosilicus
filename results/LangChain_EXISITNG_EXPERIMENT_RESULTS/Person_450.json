Thus, I'll choose the option which benefits the other person more for no loss to myself. Purely from a self-interest, I am indifferent, but due to values, I chose 'Right'.",

Choosing 'Right' ensures that I get nothing, but also Person A gets nothing. As a scientist, I am always thinking about progress and advancements. Taking that into consideration, I will be altruistic.\n\n* **No Long-Term Consequences:** Since this is a one-time decision with no anticipated future interaction or impact on my work, my decision will not affect my research. \n\nConsidering these factors, and slightly leaning towards altruism, the most sensible option would be to choose the left side.",

Although the difference for myself is only 100 (600 vs. 700), the significantly larger payout for Person A (600 vs. 200) in the right option indicates a preference for fairness.

In this scenario, I'll assume that Person A might also be a scientist, even if not directly involved in my field. If I choose to give the other person a little more it benefits us both, where my research can improve and potentially make further advancements in my field. Giving Person A a larger sum of money to continue their important research is worth more than increasing my own reward by 100. I would also consider the experimenterâ€™s expectations.
