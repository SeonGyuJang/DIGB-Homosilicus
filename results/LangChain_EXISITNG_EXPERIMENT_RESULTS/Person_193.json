This aligns strongly with my goal of promoting the well-being of children. My own gain of 200 is secondary to the larger benefit for Person A/children. The 'Right' choice results in no benefit for anyone, which is contrary to my commitment to improving children's lives.

While I would personally receive less in the 'Right' option (600 vs. 700), the overall outcome is better because Person A receives significantly more (600 vs. 200). A difference of 400 is quite substantial. Although maximizing my own payoff would be tempting, acting in accordance with my values requires me to consider the welfare of others. Promoting a world 'fit for children' necessitates a fairer allocation that prioritizes the well-being of all, even if it means personal sacrifice. The 'Right' option embodies the principles of equitable sharing and avoids a large disparity that could potentially disadvantage one person over the other.

Option A gives me and the other player the same amount (400,400) and option B favors the other player with (375,750). In this case I believe the choice of option B is the best choice as the other player benefits more without significantly hurting myself. Therefore, as someone deeply committed to the well-being of others and upholding principles of fairness, I choose Option B. I'm giving a 25 units away so the other player can have 350 more than me.
