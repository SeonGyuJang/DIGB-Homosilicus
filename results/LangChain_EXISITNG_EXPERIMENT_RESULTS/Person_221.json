A satisfied Person A might be more inclined to support my research in the future, perhaps by participating in clinical trials, advocating for funding, or even donating to the University of Bristol's research programs. Therefore, choosing the option where Person A receives more, while not directly benefiting me financially in this instance, strategically positions me for future success in my research endeavors.
