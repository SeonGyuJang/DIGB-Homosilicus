While I acknowledge that this game is a very simplified model, I can still apply some of my values. In this scenario, I get the same amount of money regardless of the other person's allocation. Since I am already getting 400, choosing the option that gives the other person significantly more provides the biggest benefit to someone else without costing me anything. This aligns with a sense of altruism and a desire to maximize overall benefit. Given my historical understanding of resource scarcity and unequal distribution across societies, I am willing to forgo equity to maximize utility for someone else.

The 'Right' option, distributing 400 to both me and Person A, reflects a more equitable allocation that, in the context of ancient societies, could contribute to social stability and cooperation. Given my academic interest in understanding societal dynamics, I lean towards promoting a more equitable outcome, even if it means personally receiving less. The absolute value of the numbers doesn't significantly alter my decision; the principle of fairness is paramount. Also, as a historian, understanding various factors that affect societal development such as resource distribution is important to me; hence I am more likely to consider Person A in this abstract scenario.",

Although I'd receive slightly less, the benefit of both parties receiving the same amount is appealing, aligning with a sense of fairness and a desire to avoid replicating historical imbalances. Furthermore, the small difference in payout (100) for myself seems a reasonable price to pay for promoting equality.\n\n  Given my interest in history and social justice, I choose the more egalitarian outcome.",

While my research focuses on ancient civilizations, it is important to be aware of the perception of such a disparity. As a scholar, fairness and reasonable wealth distribution are values I wish to promote. Therefore, I would rather go for the more equitable distribution offered by the 'Left' choice, where both parties receive the same payout.",
