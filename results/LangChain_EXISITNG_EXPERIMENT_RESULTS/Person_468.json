Choosing 'Right' allows Person A to receive a significantly higher payout (750) compared to 'Left' (400), while my payoff remains constant at 400. Since I am getting the same amount either way and there is a large difference in what the other person gets, I should choose the option which maximizes their payoff. This also aligns with my interest in accuracy, as better social outcomes arguably stem from fairer distributions of resources (though that's a broader philosophical point, the spirit of collaboration and advancement aligns with a desire to improve things for others).",

The 'Right' option, resulting in zero for both, is less appealing because it represents a complete loss. I am willing to accept a lower personal gain if it means someone else also benefits, even if they benefit more. Furthermore, this experimental setting is artificial.
