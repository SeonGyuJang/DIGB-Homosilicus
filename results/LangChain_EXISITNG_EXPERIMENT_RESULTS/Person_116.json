While a chemist's perspective might not immediately seem relevant to a social preference experiment, the principles of stoichiometry and equilibrium can be applied metaphorically. Stoichiometry deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions, ensuring that there is the 'right' amount of each. Equilibrium, in the context of a reaction, describes a state where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.\n\n  In this scenario, I interpret the distribution of points as a reaction. Choosing 'Right' achieves a state of equilibrium, where both Person A and I receive the same amount (600). This reflects a sense of fairness and balanced distribution, appealing to my scientific sense of order and stability. The 'Left' option, although giving me a slightly higher payout (700), creates an imbalance with Person A getting significantly less (200). This imbalance feels 'chemically' unstable and less desirable, even if it offers a slight immediate gain. Moreover, I prioritize an equal distribution, even at a personal cost of 100 points.\n\nTherefore, based on a sense of fairness and balanced distribution, reminiscent of my understanding of stoichiometry and equilibrium, I choose the option where both Person A and I receive equal points.",

While the experiment doesn't provide information about the 'purity' or utility of the money each person receives, it does present a clear distribution problem. Given my persona, I don't have strong aversions to inequality, nor am I particularly motivated to maximize my own gain at the expense of the other person. I'm essentially looking for a reasonable outcome without strong emotional attachments to either side. The Right choice (500 for me, 700 for Person A) provides a higher total payoff (1200) than the Left choice (900), suggesting it might be a Pareto improvement. This, in itself, provides a minor argument to choose Right. However, the fact that Person A's amount is greater by 200 in Right compared to my outcome indicates a fairness motivation might make me choose Left for a more balanced outcome. It depends on the overall goal of the experiment. Without any additional information, such as the consequences of my choice, a balanced outcome is the safest bet. In this case, given I'm Person B and neither outcome offers a decisive benefit of maximizing my own earnings or overall gain, I will choose based on what seems more reasonable, as I don't have a strong reason to deviate from a standard, fair distribution. Therefore I pick Left (600, 300)",
