While the Wheel teaches us about the fickleness of fortune, it also hints towards generosity and the potential for upward mobility. Though I am not at the 'bottom' in either option, I see no reason to deny Person A a larger share of the metaphorical 'turn of the wheel,' especially when it costs me nothing.

However, given my academic focus on the tragic consequences of such uneven distributions, I am morally compelled to consider the broader implications. While personal gain is tempting, the alternative, a more equitable distribution (400 for both), resonates more strongly with a just and balanced society â€“ a concept often yearned for in the face of the Wheel's relentless spin.

On the left, I gain a modest 200, while Person A receives a substantial 800. This mirrors the Wheel elevating Person A, while I experience a small gain. On the right, both of us receive nothing, a potential 'fall' for both. While a purely rational, self-interested actor might choose the left option to gain something, even a small amount, my understanding of the Wheel's allegory pushes me to consider the potential for resentment or envy the larger disparity might create. However, the Wheel is about fate, not spite. Choosing the 'Right' option feels like a denial of the Wheel's potential for upward mobility, however skewed in this instance. Furthermore, accepting the 200 doesn't change the fact that A is already the 'favored' individual, and denying myself 200 out of some sense of resentment is foolish. Thus, acknowledging the uneven distribution granted by the Wheel, I will accept the modest gain offered to me.",

The 'Right' choice (600 for me, 600 for Person A) represents a more equitable distribution, a momentary equilibrium before the Wheel inevitably turns again. While it offers a slightly smaller personal gain, the avoidance of creating a stark disparity seems more aligned with the cyclical nature of fortune. Perhaps a humbler, more balanced starting point is preferable, acknowledging the Wheel's potential for future reversals. Furthermore, the very study of the Wheel encourages an understanding of human suffering when fortunes fall. Thus, I wish to avoid a situation where it appears that I would be intentionally creating a great disparity between my own circumstances and those of others.

Choosing the option where Person A receives a larger reward (700) while I receive a slightly smaller one (500) seems more aligned with the spirit of the Wheel. It acknowledges the potential for others to rise and reminds me that my own 'good fortune' is not guaranteed. Furthermore, a degree of inequality is natural, as fortunes vary widely. While I'm tempted by the higher payoff on the Left, choosing the Right option reflects an acceptance of the Wheel's arbitrary influence and a move away from pure self-interest.

While material wealth is not to be scorned, the Wheel teaches us that equitable distribution, or at least the appearance of it, can be more valuable in the long run than simply maximizing one's own gain. The Wheel's turning eventually impacts everyone. Although the right option offers Person A a significantly larger sum, and offers me slightly less, the left option offers a perfectly equal split. The concept of equity appeals to my scholarly ideals. However, the difference to me is relatively small (25), and the difference to A is relatively large (350). While I ponder the Wheel, I also want to consider efficiency. Ultimately, the slightly lesser value of the equal split outweighs the efficiency gains. I am not driven by envy, so a larger reward for A is not a disincentive.",
