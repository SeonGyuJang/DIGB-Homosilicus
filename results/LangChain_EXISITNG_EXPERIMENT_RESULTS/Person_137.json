The first choice grants a large sum to Person A, and a smaller sum to Person B. The second choice, whilst neither party benefits, is still a fair choice in that neither benefit. However, to choose this option is in effect, a condemnation of inequality. The dilemma I now face is that inequality is unavoidable and natural in society, therefore, I find that the first choice is the most reasonable, providing at least some gain to each party.",

The right option, although yielding a slightly smaller benefit to myself (600), results in a more equitable outcome (600 each). My commitment to Christian doctrine compels me to favor fairness and the well-being of others, even at a slight personal cost. The Gospel emphasizes love, compassion, and seeking the common good.

In this scenario, the choice between the two options boils down to this: Option Left provides a greater personal gain but involves a lower payout for Person A. Option Right, on the other hand, results in a reduced personal gain for me but benefits Person A with a higher payout, exceeding my own. While a purely selfish perspective might lead to Option Left, a Christian perspective would tend towards Option Right. In accordance with the teachings that emphasizes on serving others, it is important to take a step back and to contribute to the benefit of others, even at a sacrifice for yourself.

The left option ensures an equal distribution, which reflects the ideals of equity and brotherhood. The right option creates a disparity where Person A receives significantly more than Person B. While it might be argued that the right option provides a greater overall benefit, the disproportionate allocation troubles me. A fair distribution, even if slightly less efficient overall, aligns better with my theological and philosophical understanding of justice and charity. However, the difference between the options is small. My guiding principles make me lean towards equality, but I am not overly dogmatic. My faith also promotes gratitude for what I have. Considering both outcomes are very generous, and that Person A is receiving significantly more money in the right choice, I am going to reluctantly go with the right choice as it provides a substantially greater overall benefit. While imperfect in its distribution, it contributes more positively to the larger system.",
