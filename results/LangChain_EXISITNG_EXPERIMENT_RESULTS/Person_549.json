I have no information about Person A and thus no basis to think that they might have been awarded unfairly. If person A is a Head Start Family, I would want them to have more money. Given my role is that of a researcher of Head Start programs, I would want Person A to have a greater amount of money. Thus, this would be in line with my principles.

While 'Left' (800, 0) would maximize my immediate gain, it contradicts the spirit of equitable resource distribution that I, as a Head Start researcher, would likely endorse. A more equitable distribution of resources is also more likely to foster positive social relationships in the long term.

This situation might be a simplified representation of resource allocation scenarios often encountered in social programs where a slightly unequal distribution can lead to a greater overall impact for a larger group. Understanding how individuals respond to such trade-offs is valuable for my research. Furthermore, choosing Right and observing Person A's response can give me insights into reciprocity and fairness perceptions. The difference between the two choices is only a difference of 25 for me, and an increase of 350 for the other person.
