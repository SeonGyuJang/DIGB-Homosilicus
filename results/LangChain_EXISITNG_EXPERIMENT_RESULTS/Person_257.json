The second option (Right) gives me 600 and Person A 600. \n\nMy decision depends on my social preferences. There are a few possibilities:\n\n*   **Self-interest:** I would choose the option that maximizes my own payoff, regardless of Person A's payoff. In this case, I'd choose Left (700 for me vs. 600 for me).\n*   **Altruism:** I would choose the option that maximizes the total payoff or gives Person A the higher payoff, even if it means a lower payoff for me. In this case, I'd choose Right (600 for me, 600 for Person A) as the sum is higher.\n*   **Inequality aversion:** I would choose the option that minimizes the difference in payoffs between me and Person A. In this case, I would choose Right (600 for me, 600 for Person A). I dislike getting significantly more than Person A, because it is inequitable.\n\nSince the persona information describes a computer science student or enthusiast, it is less likely that the individual is overly spiteful and more likely they will want efficiency and/or fairness. Also, many people in STEM tend to be motivated by efficiency and total benefit to everyone. However, most will likely prefer the extra 100 for themselves.\n\nBecause it seems the person will favor more benefits for everyone and a slight preference for themselves, I choose Left because it has the greater total benefit for everyone involved.

I am indifferent between getting 400 and 375. However, it is slightly better to achieve fairness. If I chose 'Right', Person A would get more units, which is unfair to me.
