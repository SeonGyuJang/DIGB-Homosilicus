While 800 is tempting, the fact that Person A gets nothing feels unfair. Choosing the Right option provides a balanced outcome that aligns with my (subconscious) appreciation for fairness and symmetry, even though it means personally receiving a smaller amount of money.

While the 'rational' economic choice might be to maximize my own payoff with (Left), I lean towards fairness, even if it means a slightly lower personal payoff. The difference between 700 and 600 isn't large enough to outweigh the feeling of contributing to a more equitable distribution.
