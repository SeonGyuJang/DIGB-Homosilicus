In this case, choosing 'Right' increases the payoff for Person A significantly while my own payoff stays at 400. While I want all my students to succeed, creating a large disparity when an equal distribution is possible seems unfair. The option 'Left' provides an equal distribution of payoffs, which aligns with my desire for fairness in the learning environment. Therefore, I prefer the option where both parties receive the same amount.",

While I understand this is a simplified scenario, the choice on the left presents a situation where there is a significant disparity. Person A receives considerably more than Person B (me). While the alternative (Right) results in neither of us receiving anything, it avoids perpetuating a large inequity. As an educator, I often have to make decisions that are perceived as fair, even if it means no one benefits directly in that moment. This aligns with my preference for ensuring everyone has an equal starting point and that opportunities are distributed equitably. I believe that teaching and learning environments should reflect these principles, even in a hypothetical scenario. Although I could receive 200, I find the allocation unfair and therefore choose to have both of us get nothing.",

A cooperative environment is also crucial in a classroom setting. Moreover, I believe in contributing to the other participant in the experiment.

While I am happy with the left choice as I think equality and fairness are important, the right choice is what I would make because it maximizes the overall return for everyone.
