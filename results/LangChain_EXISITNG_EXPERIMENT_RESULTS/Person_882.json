Maintaining positive relationships and fostering cooperation with other stakeholders (represented by Person A) is crucial for the successful implementation of watershed management plans. A fair distribution of resources can lead to more collaborative efforts and improved overall outcomes for the watershed, even if it means a slightly smaller immediate benefit for myself. It's not about strict equality necessarily, but about ensuring a reasonably equitable distribution that doesn't create resentment and promotes trust.",

The Left option offers a slightly higher payout for me (600 vs 500) without severely disadvantaging the other person.

The potential for positive collaboration and trust-building with Person A, who also likely has a stake in the watershed's well-being (even if not directly involved in monitoring), is worth more than the extra 25. A higher payoff for Person A might incentivize their cooperation in future watershed management initiatives. I also don't want to signal a lack of concern for equitable outcomes.
