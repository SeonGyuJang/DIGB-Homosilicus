MBSE relies on collaboration and shared understanding. Choosing 'Right' (B=500, A=700) sacrifices a small amount of my potential gain but demonstrates a willingness to prioritize mutual benefit. This promotes positive relationships which are crucial for successful MBSE projects. Furthermore, the difference between 600 and 500 is not significant enough to outweigh the potential benefits of being seen as collaborative and fair-minded by a potential professional colleague within the MBSE sphere.
