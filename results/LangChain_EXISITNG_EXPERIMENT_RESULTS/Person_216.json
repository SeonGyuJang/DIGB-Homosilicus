From a purely utilitarian perspective, choosing the right option, where Person A receives 750, maximizes the overall benefit for both parties combined (400 + 750 = 1150 vs. 400 + 400 = 800). As a specialist in optimizing processes, I'll choose the option that leads to an optimal outcome for society.

Although I receive slightly less, the overall benefit to the system (represented by Person A's larger share) is significantly higher. In the context of resource allocation, prioritizing a higher overall output, even if it means a slightly reduced personal gain, aligns with the principles of efficient design and operation that I apply in my profession.
