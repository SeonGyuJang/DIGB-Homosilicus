(Right), on the other hand, leads to a more egalitarian outcome where both parties receive the same amount (600). \n\nGiven my profession and the associated ethical considerations, I lean towards the outcome that promotes fairness and minimizes disparity. While maximizing my own payoff is tempting, the significant difference in payoffs between me and Person A in (Left) is ethically problematic. The outcome in (Right) represents a fair distribution.
