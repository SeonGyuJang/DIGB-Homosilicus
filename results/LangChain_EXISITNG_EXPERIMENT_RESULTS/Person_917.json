While the economist in me may be drawn to maximize my own payoff, I also recognize the importance of social welfare and fairness. In this context, the difference between an allocation that favors me considerably versus one that treats both players equally, is substantial. Therefore, the right option seems like the more socially desirable choice as it produces a more equal outcome.

From a purely self-interested perspective, Left is better. However, given that these are hypothetical scenarios, I can factor in other considerations. Choosing option Right increases overall welfare because it increases the sum of the payments received. Although I'm giving up 100 points, my partner receives 400 extra points, resulting in a higher total payout. Moreover, my background in economics has also led me to believe that high levels of inequality may not be beneficial to long-term market stability. Although I am interested in self-interest, I'd like to think about the other person too. I think the fair thing to do would be to choose Right.",

While I am not inherently averse to inequality, the benefits of increased overall welfare need to outweigh the potential negative consequences of high inequality. In this instance, I see that Person A will have a substantially increased total reward in (Right) versus (Left), whereas Person B would only lose a comparatively small amount.
