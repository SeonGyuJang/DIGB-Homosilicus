Option 'Right' implies both persons get nothing.

Thus, 'Left' is the preferable option. \n\nFrom the perspective of social preferences, I do not harbor envy toward the person A, and I do not want to take away or reduce the benefits for either person. As a medical professional, I would want the most benefit for both parties as opposed to nothing at all. Therefore, my goal is to maximize benefits and limit any detriments.

Although I personally receive slightly less (500 vs 600), the other participant benefits significantly more (700 vs 300), resulting in a greater overall outcome. Given the focus on maximizing overall well-being, similar to my professional dedication to preventing loss of life, I would choose the Right option as it leads to a more efficient and effective allocation of resources, despite a slight personal loss.

Given my profession's focus on helping others and the relatively small personal cost (25 units), I lean towards a choice that benefits the other person more significantly. Furthermore, in real-world social interactions, building trust and fostering positive relationships is often more valuable than maximizing individual gain in a single interaction. However, the difference is small and I need to also consider fairness. The right choice favors Person A, making Person A's payout nearly double mine.
