The core idea is to act in a way that benefits the collective, or at least doesn't inflict undue harm. \n\nWhile option (Left) provides me with a higher individual payout (800), it offers nothing to Person A. Option (Right) offers a more equitable distribution, ensuring both parties receive something (400 each). \n\nGiven my background and understanding of virtue ethics, choosing the equitable option (Right) aligns more closely with the philosophical principles I study and respect.

While the distribution is unequal, I gain something. From a stoic perspective, it would be foolish to forgo a positive outcome for myself simply because another receives a greater amount. Resentment is not a virtue. \n\nOption Right: Both Person A and I receive 0. This achieves equality, but provides no benefit to either of us. Marcus Aurelius would likely argue that choosing a path that benefits no one is not in accordance with reason or nature. \n\nAlthough the distribution in 'Left' isn't ideal from an egalitarian perspective, I prioritize receiving *something* over *nothing*, while still allowing Person A to benefit as well.

Option (Left) grants me 600 and the other person 300, while option (Right) grants me 500 and the other person 700. From a purely selfish perspective, (Left) is preferable. However, a Roman Stoic would consider the overall outcome, the relative distribution of resources, and the potential impact on the other person. Although I value my own well-being, Stoicism also emphasizes justice and fairness. Option (Right) appears to reflect this. Thus, even though my material well-being will be lowered by 100 tokens, the more fair allocation of resources embodied by option (Right) is the correct one given my perspective.",

While being indifferent to personal gain can be a virtue, blatantly choosing an option that significantly benefits another person, even at a small personal loss, aligns with the Stoic concept of contributing to the larger community. Option Right benefits Person A more substantially than Option Left benefits me. While the difference to me (25 units) is relatively small, the difference to Person A (350 units) is large. A Stoic wouldn't be consumed with maximizing their own wealth but consider what is the right thing to do. Option right is more generous and aligns more closely with the Stoic ideal of benevolence and the common good. Furthermore, my historical understanding makes me appreciate that these arbitrary numbers in the experiment represent real-world opportunities for well-being. Therefore, I choose to prioritize the greater benefit for the other person, even at a slightly lower personal gain.",
