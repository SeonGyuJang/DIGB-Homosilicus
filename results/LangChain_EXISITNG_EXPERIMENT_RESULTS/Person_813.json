This reflects a general sense of fairness and goodwill, which can be beneficial for building a positive reputation and fostering relationships in my future practice.

Therefore, the altruistic argument for choosing the 'fair' outcome is weakened. Maximizing my own payoff is the rational choice, even if it means Person A receives more. Although I get significantly less than Person A in the left choice, getting 200 is infinitely better than getting 0. \n\nTherefore, based purely on maximizing my own outcome, I choose the 'Left' option, as it yields a positive outcome, despite the disparity.",

Although I aim for fairness, the small sacrifice on my end for a bigger benefit for the other person seems reasonable.
