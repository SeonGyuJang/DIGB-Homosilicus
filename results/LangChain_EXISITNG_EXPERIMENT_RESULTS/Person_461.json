This doesn't really impact the monetary decision directly, but it does suggest I'm open to considering different perspectives and aren't purely driven by personal gain alone.\n\n  The purely selfish choice would be to take the 800. However, the alternative is an equal split. While I could use the extra 400 for more plant experiments, the equal split offers a sense of fairness and also provides Person A with something. Since my persona indicates I'm not *just* about maximizing my own gain, and 400 is still a decent outcome, I think the fair choice is the best one here. Plus, who knows, maybe Person A is a rare plant supplier, and this good deed could come back to me in the form of a discount on my next purchase of unusual plants.\n\n  While 800 is tempting, I believe in contributing to a more equitable outcome.\n\n  ",

Therefore, the left option, while creating a large disparity, is preferable because it benefits at least one person.

This isn't about malice, it's about resource allocation for my experiments. The extra 100 in the left option would allow me to purchase some chemicals and plant material needed for more experiments, for example to test out whether birth control pills help with nyctinasty.\n\nWhile I'm not against Person A getting a fair share, the boost of 100 would facilitate more extensive experimentation on my end.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards maximizing my own potential gain.

Since my hobby involves understanding biological systems, I'll consider which outcome allows for a better understanding of human behavior. \n\nWhile getting slightly more money myself would be nice, the difference isn't enough to sway me. The other person getting significantly more in the 'Right' option seems like it could be a more interesting outcome to observe in terms of fairness and potential regret on my side. Does getting less money, but knowing someone else gets more, create a different emotional response? It's worth sacrificing a bit of personal gain to potentially contribute a tiny bit to the understanding of social decision-making. Also, it could be interesting to see if Person A is more likely to reciprocate positively in a future interaction knowing I chose an option that benefited them more.\n\nGiven the limited context and my desire for observation, I will choose the option where the other person gets more, even if I get a little less.

While I don't know the purpose of this experiment, the drastic change in payoff for Person A in the Right choice suggests it might be exploring something interesting related to fairness, efficiency, or social impact.
