This scenario presents a choice between an equal distribution of resources (400 for both Person A and Person B) and a slightly unequal distribution where Person A receives more (750). The key is to consider whether choosing the unequal distribution could, in any way, indirectly contribute to the opioid crisis or hinder efforts to combat it. \n\nIn this isolated scenario, the difference in payoffs doesn't directly relate to opioid use or treatment. Choosing either option won't directly worsen or improve the opioid epidemic. However, considering that a more equitable distribution may foster greater cooperation and trust within a society, it can contribute indirectly to the betterment of conditions. \n\nHowever, from a purely utilitarian perspective within the constraints of the immediate decision (and assuming 'Person A' isn't associated with negative opioid-related implications), maximizing overall utility makes sense. Therefore, I will choose the option where Person A receives more, as this leads to a higher overall amount for everyone in the experiment, even though the outcome for myself (Person B) is identical.\n\n",

While option (Left) provides me with a larger absolute payoff, option (Right) leads to a greater aggregate benefit between myself and Person A (1200 vs 900).
