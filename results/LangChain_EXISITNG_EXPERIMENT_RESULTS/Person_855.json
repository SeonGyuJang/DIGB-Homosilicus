The right option represents a more equitable distribution, with both person A and myself receiving 400. My mindfulness practice encourages me to cultivate compassion and reduce selfish behavior.

Although the Left option leads to an unequal distribution, it still benefits both parties significantly more than the alternative. Choosing 'Right' to avoid inequality would result in everyone being worse off, which doesn't align with a mindful and compassionate approach. While the inequality might initially trigger some aversion, a mindful perspective involves observing these emotions without being controlled by them. It involves recognizing that maximizing overall welfare, even if unequally distributed, can contribute to a more positive state of affairs for everyone involved. My intention is to choose the option that fosters a more positive and productive result for all.
