In this specific case, choosing (Right) guarantees that neither of us benefits materially, but it also prevents any potential for resentment or a feeling of being exploited, which would negatively impact my cognitive ability to focus on quantum physics.

While a purely selfish perspective would lead me to choose 'Left', the difference is small. The 'Right' option significantly benefits Person A (750 vs 400). Although I am not explicitly altruistic, I value fairness and a sense of mutual benefit. Given the relatively minor personal sacrifice (25 points), contributing substantially to Person A's earnings seems like a reasonable and ethically sound decision. While my main pursuit is quantum physics, being a decent human being isn't mutually exclusive. Therefore, considering the small personal loss versus the large gain for Person A, I will choose 'Right'.",
