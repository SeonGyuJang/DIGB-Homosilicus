Since both options give me the same amount (400), I would rationally choose the option that also gives the other person more. This is because there's no trade-off for me – I get the same regardless.

The 'Left' option provides me with a larger personal gain (800) while leaving Person A with nothing. This outcome reinforces a kind of selfishness that goes against my commitment to helping others. The 'Right' option, while giving me a smaller personal gain (400), promotes a more equitable distribution, providing Person A with 400 as well. Although I might personally *prefer* a larger payout, choosing the 'Right' option aligns better with my values of fairness and ethical consideration for others, mirroring my concerns for patients' well-being over potentially unnecessary medication.

The difference in personal gain (100) is relatively small. Choosing 'Right' ensures a more equitable distribution of payoffs (600 for both Person A and me).

Option Left gives us both equal standing, where both Person A and I get 400. Option Right offers 375 to me and 750 to Person A. Even though Person A receives more, I am inclined to select the Option Right. From my perspective, as a pediatrician who specializes in treating children with cough and cold symptoms, I am more interested in the outcome for the larger population of young children potentially affected by CCM over-prescription. I'm interested in evidence-based medicine, lack of awareness among doctors, and the public about the risks associated with CCMs. If Person A receives more, they can get more insight into evidence-based information on CCM. I believe that I am still in a good enough position to advocate for children.
