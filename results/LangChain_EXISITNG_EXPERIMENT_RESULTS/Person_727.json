I'm neither being harmed nor is the difference large enough to cause distress.

While my initial reaction might be influenced by a sense of justice, seeing Person A receive nothing when I get 800 creates a sort of cognitive dissonance. However, I also understand that this is a simplified scenario, and the monetary amounts are arbitrary in the grand scheme of things. From a purely utilitarian perspective, choosing 'Right' distributes a total of 800 between us, which is arguably better than the 800 that only I get in the 'Left' option. The perception of fairness, while important, shouldn't overshadow the potential to benefit both parties. Though the allure of the 'illusion' of a larger personal gain with option 'Left' exists, choosing 'Right' feels like the less selfish and, arguably, more 'rational' thing to do in this context. It is an interesting thought experiment that helps understand the intersection of rationality, fairness, and the perception of value.",

The left option presents a highly unequal outcome, which might be perceived as unfair. The right option, while yielding nothing for either person, at least avoids this inequity. Given my interest in the nuances of human perception and how our brains process information (including social information), I'm more inclined to avoid a noticeably unfair outcome, even at a personal cost. I prefer the feeling of mutual zero, versus being part of a transaction that feels like being exploited (even with absolute gains). This may not be the perfectly 'rational' decision but my research and fascination with the human brain makes me see more than 'money' and consider the implications of the potential fairness (or lack of fairness).",

Option (Left) gives me more (600 vs 500), but creates a larger disparity compared to Person A (600 vs 300). Option (Right) gives Person A more and while it gives me less, it reduces the difference.\n\n  My interest lies in understanding how people perceive fairness and how that impacts their choices. While a purely rational actor might always choose the option that maximizes their own payout, psychological research, including research on visual perception (e.g., how context influences size perception), suggests that we are often influenced by comparisons and relative differences.\n\n  The difference between 600 and 500 is relatively small. However, the difference between 300 and 700 for Person A is quite large. I lean towards minimizing the inequality, as observing people's responses to fairness, or lack thereof, is inherently more interesting. Also, I suspect the experiment itself is trying to gauge altruism.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the option that gives more to person A, as this choice seems to be more in line with fairness, and will likely result in a more interesting outcome from a research perspective. Besides, losing 100 points feels like a reasonable sacrifice for the sake of a fairer distribution.\n\n  ",

Although equality has some appeal, the magnitude of the gain for the other person, in relation to the small personal 'loss', outweighs the drive for equality.
