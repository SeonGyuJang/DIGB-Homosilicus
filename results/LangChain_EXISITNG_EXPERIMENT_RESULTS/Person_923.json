While I could choose the option that offers the same payout for myself, I recognize that allowing Person A to receive a significantly higher sum (750 vs. 400) doesn't negatively impact my own outcome. In fact, a more equitable distribution could foster trust and reciprocity in future interactions, both within this experiment and, metaphorically, in the broader international landscape. A core tenet of many international relations theories is that creating a system of mutual benefits and understanding enhances global stability and cooperation. Choosing the right option promotes overall benefit without impacting me negatively. This aligns with my understanding of the value of equitable outcomes in international affairs and promotes trust and potentially future gains.",

My expertise encompasses the sovereignty of independent territorial states, the influence of non-state actors, and the impact of globalization. While traditionally, my focus is on nations, the underlying principles of resource distribution and relative gains also apply to this scenario. \n\nChoosing between the two options presents a classic dilemma: maximize personal gain or strive for a more equitable outcome. Option (Left) maximizes my own 'resources' (800) but leaves Person A with nothing. This resembles a zero-sum scenario, where one actor's gain is directly another's loss, which can foster resentment and instability â€“ outcomes I typically analyze and try to understand at the international level.\n\nOption (Right) offers a more balanced distribution, allocating 400 to both Person A and myself. While I receive a smaller individual payoff, the overall outcome is arguably more 'just'. The relative gains are reduced, lessening the potential for imbalance and conflict. My research indicates that these kinds of outcomes may create a more positive experience that ultimately benefits both actors.\n\nIn this specific case, while I am aware of the temptation to maximise my personal gains with the 'Left' option, the principles of equality and shared benefits inherent in a globalized world, as well as a desire for social stability, lead me towards the 'Right' option.\n",

I understand the importance of considering the impact of globalization and non-state actors on state sovereignty, but in this isolated decision, the only actors are Person A and myself. Furthermore, my knowledge of trade agreements such as GATT and WTO stresses the importance of mutual benefit and avoiding exploitation of another party for personal gain, even if there are no apparent consequences. Therefore, while choosing 'Right' implies no personal gain, it reinforces a sense of shared outcome and eliminates the chance of being viewed as complicit in creating or accepting gross inequality. It demonstrates a commitment to fairness, a value I believe crucial in international relations.",

The choices presented in this experiment, while simplified, mirror real-world scenarios where states must decide between maximizing their own absolute gains versus relative gains compared to other actors. While I am operating as an individual here, my academic background inevitably informs my decision-making process. \n\nChoosing the 'Left' option gives me a higher absolute payoff (700 versus 600). However, it also creates a significant inequality between Person A and myself (700 vs 200). This scenario could be interpreted through a lens of relative gains, where I am comparatively much better off than Person A. Although a deep understanding of international relations does not necessarily imply an aversion to inequality, the high inequality in the 'Left' option could lead to future friction. \n\nThe 'Right' option offers a lower absolute payoff (600 versus 700) but creates equality (600 for both). \n\nConsidering both absolute and relative gains, and reflecting on the importance of stable and predictable relations in international contexts, I find the 'Right' choice more appealing. The diminished payoff for myself is offset by the establishment of a fair and equal distribution that I see as having more benefit for the whole. Even if it means taking a slightly less advantageous position in the short term. Also, as a scholar, I value fairness and justice and wish to show that in practice. I think this option is also optimal in the long term as it is more fair and shows a better sense of justice.",

However, my academic background compels me to consider the broader implications. The discipline of International Relations acknowledges that stable and cooperative systems are often predicated on a degree of fairness and reciprocity. A system perceived as excessively unequal can breed resentment and instability.\n\nOption Right (500 for me, 700 for Person A) represents a slight concession from my maximum personal gain. However, it results in a significantly larger benefit for Person A. This could be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill or a commitment to a more equitable distribution. Given my interest in the workings of global cooperation, and the potential for perceived fairness to foster more stable relationships, I am inclined to choose Right.\n\nFurthermore, my knowledge of organizations like GATT and WTO, and their role in mediating trade and economic interactions, reinforces the notion that cooperation and compromise are key to long-term benefit. This choice is also partially informed by a curiosity to observe how Person A might respond to this choice, which might reveal something interesting about their perceptions of fairness or justice.\n\nWhile a purely rational actor might choose Left, my understanding of the complexities of international relations, the importance of perceived fairness, and the potential for cooperation, push me toward Right.",

While this is a purely hypothetical scenario with no real-world consequences, my academic understanding leads me to favor a more equitable distribution. Also, given the emphasis on concepts of sovereignty and the growing debates related to globalization, maintaining a degree of parity, even in small decisions, aligns with my perception of a more stable international system, at least theoretically. In this scenario, fairness is preferred over maximizing my own gains, to a point. The difference between 400 and 375 is small enough to allow for choosing equality.",
