Although I would personally earn less, I will consider that my overall goal in life is to maximize utility, and this utility is influenced by my beliefs about fairness. Therefore, it would make sense to forego the opportunity to earn more money in exchange for a more fair outcome. This outcome is especially preferable when there is zero cost to me.

However, as an expert in the Excess Earnings method, I also understand the importance of considering factors beyond just immediate gains. The Excess Earnings method is based on the idea of capturing all intangible asset value. If Person A had a lower payout, I would be tempted to choose the Left option, in order to earn more. However, the difference in payout is just 100, so it is reasonable that my intangible asset of fairness would have a value in excess of 100. The Right option achieves a more equitable distribution, which, in the real world, can contribute to improved collaboration, reputation, and overall long-term success. While the immediate financial gain is slightly lower, the perceived value of fairness, which can translate to greater future returns, nudges me toward the Right option. I will choose the option that promotes equality, even if I gain a lesser reward, as the intangible assets of fairness is great.",

However, Option Right gives Person A a significantly larger payoff (700) compared to Option Left (300). \n\nWhile a purely self-interested perspective would favor Option Left, my professional experience in valuing companies based on their earnings potential leads me to consider the overall value generated. Option Right creates a larger total payoff (500+700=1200) compared to Option Left (600+300=900). Although my personal payoff is slightly lower, the higher overall value generated by Option Right appeals to my understanding of sound economic principles and long-term value creation.\n\nFurthermore, from a fairness perspective, the difference between my earnings and Person A's earnings is relatively small in Option Right (200) compared to Option Left (300).\n\nTherefore, while I am motivated to increase my own outcome, I want to also act in the interest of the group if the decrease in my absolute outcome is minimal.",
