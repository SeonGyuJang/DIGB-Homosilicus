Given that the amounts don't directly relate to my product or business, the only real aspect of the choice is what distribution is most equitable. Since the 'Left' option provides both Person A and myself with some benefit, albeit unevenly distributed, it is preferable to the 'Right' option where no one gets anything.

Giving more to Person A is generally preferred when their increased benefit significantly outweighs my decreased benefit, thus making the overall outcome potentially better from a societal efficiency standpoint.
