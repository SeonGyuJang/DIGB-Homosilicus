Choosing 'Right' gives both of us nothing. I am inherently concerned with equity and fairness. While it might seem beneficial to choose the 'Left' option, I cannot ignore the significantly unequal distribution of the resource. Choosing 'Right' ensures equality, which in this case of high inequality, is more aligned with my values. Since the amounts are relatively small, sacrificing a small personal gain to avoid a very unequal allocation, I am choosing 'Right'",

While it might seem like I'm sacrificing personal gain, I believe that promoting fairness aligns with my values as a researcher who fights for health equity. Unequal distributions can reflect and exacerbate existing disparities, something I actively work against. Therefore, the equality reflected in the 'Right' option is more valuable to me than the additional personal gain in the 'Left' option. Choosing 'Right' demonstrates a commitment to fair outcomes.",

While the scenario doesn't explicitly state that Person A is part of an underserved community I am advocating for, I must consider whether the benefit to them justifies a slightly lower payoff for myself. Assuming the role of a fair-minded researcher, I prioritize a slightly more equitable distribution of resources. Even though this experiment is likely abstract and not directly linked to health outcomes, in a generalized context, I tend to give up some benefit to help others, and I want to signal this tendency.

Given my professional commitment to equity and the substantial increase in overall welfare implied by the right choice, and the fact that I do not know who Person A is, I would be inclined to pick Right as I assume they might be a member of a community which has a disproportionate amount of need. I consider the overall well-being is more important than my individual gain in this case.",
