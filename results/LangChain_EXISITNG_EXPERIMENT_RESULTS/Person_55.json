In this social preferences experiment, I'm faced with a choice that doesn't involve physical space, but the same principles of optimization can apply. I'm choosing between two options that give me the same outcome (400). However, the 'Right' option benefits Person A more significantly (750 vs 400). Since my own payoff is unchanged, and I have no information that would make me want to disadvantage Person A, choosing the option that increases the overall 'utility' (in a very broad sense) seems like the more logical and perhaps even 'well-designed' outcome. Even though fairness considerations might be involved in other contexts, there's not a conflict between fairness and efficiency in this case, because I would get the same amount whether A gets 400 or 750. It feels appropriate to not penalize Person A when there is no benefit for me.",

The Right option, although giving me slightly less (500), provides Person A with a significantly larger payoff (700). This increased payoff for Person A seems fairer. While optimizing my own payoff is tempting, I'm mindful of the overall distribution and prefer a more equitable outcome.
