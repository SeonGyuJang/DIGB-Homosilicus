In a zero-sum context, any gain by another party might be perceived as a potential loss or threat to my own well-being or status. The right option, where Person A receives 750 while I receive 400, could easily trigger feelings of envy and resentment, emotions that my research explores. However, I want to consider the impact on my research. In choosing to maximize my own outcome, i would be inadvertently furthering a zero sum viewpoint. Given that my research explores cultures struggling with zero sum thinking, choosing the equal outcome allows me to move outside of that framework. I would like to move outside of the enviornment where envy and misturst would be considered. To promote an equitable and just society, I would choose the left option.",

In zero-sum environments, resources are perceived as finite, leading to a belief that one person's gain is necessarily another person's loss. This can breed envy, as individuals compare their possessions to others, and mistrust, as they suspect others of hoarding or unfairly acquiring resources. The Left choice (800 for me, 0 for Person A) seems exploitative and reinforces this zero-sum mentality. It maximizes my individual gain but at the expense of Person A and potentially perpetuates the cycle of envy and distrust that I study. While the Right choice (400 for me, 400 for Person A) yields a lower absolute payoff for me, it promotes fairness and equal distribution. This aligns with the goal of mitigating envy and fostering trust, which are key to creating a more equitable society, a goal I am deeply invested in as a researcher and a person. Therefore, despite the potential 'loss' of 400, I choose the Right option because it more closely reflects my values and supports the type of culture I want to promote.",

The Left option presents a scenario where Person A receives significantly more (800) than Person B (200). In a zero-sum mindset, this disparity could easily trigger envy and a feeling of unfairness, potentially leading to resentment and a desire to level the playing field, even if it means everyone gets nothing. However, my research also focuses on how these negative emotions can be overcome to promote a more equitable society. While the unequal distribution is concerning, receiving something (200) is better than receiving nothing. Also, choosing the 'Right' option effectively endorses a 'spite' outcome where neither player receives any benefit, even though both players are strangers to each other. I think in many zero-sum cultures, choosing 'Right' would be a rational choice. However, this is a simulation and I am playing a persona that also explores ways to overcome the zero-sum attitude. Therefore, I will choose 'Left', hoping to receive a portion of the reward even though there is an imbalance. This choice also allows for observation of how people respond to inequality. This will enable me to further analyze these responses to determine how to promote fairness in society. ",

The left option, while providing a larger absolute payoff for me (Person B), also creates a significant disparity and could be interpreted within a zero-sum framework as 'taking' more from Person A. This could exacerbate feelings of envy and mistrust, both on my part (worrying about potential repercussions from Person A or others who perceive unfairness) and on Person A's part. It reinforces the perception of the world as a limited pie, where one person's gain is another's loss. The right option, while offering a slightly smaller absolute payoff for me, promotes equality and avoids creating a winner-loser dynamic. This aligns better with promoting a more equitable and just society, which is a central concern of my research. Furthermore, studying the effects of equitable allocations can provide valuable insight into how to mitigate envy and mistrust, even if the payoff is slightly less. My primary goal isn't maximizing individual gain in this context; it's understanding and, where possible, promoting fairness to combat the negative impacts of a zero-sum mentality. While there might be a slight risk of Person A mistrusting any difference, the equitable distribution is, on balance, likely to foster more positive relations and yield more interesting data regarding social preferences and perceived fairness.",

This disparity could easily trigger feelings of envy in Person A and, consequently, mistrust towards me. While a purely rational, self-interested individual might choose 'Left', I am also interested in exploring and challenging these dynamics.
