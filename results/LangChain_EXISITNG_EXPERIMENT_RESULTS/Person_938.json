While Person B receives slightly less (375 vs. 400), the net positive impact of the 'Right' choice is higher, and I would prioritize maximizing the overall 'health resources' available between the two of us. While a strict equality is desirable, the increased allocation to person A represents a better utilization of resources for overall well-being. The small personal loss is acceptable in this context.
