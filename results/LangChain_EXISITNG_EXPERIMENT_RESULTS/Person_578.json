Both choices offer an equal allocation to myself, 400. Therefore, from an egoistic, purely self-interested perspective, there's no discernible difference. However, the distribution to Person A varies significantly. \n\nObjectivism, at its core, advocates for rationality, independence, and productivity. It values achievement and recognizes the validity of self-interest. Existentialism, on the other hand, emphasizes individual freedom, responsibility, and the creation of meaning. It posits that existence precedes essence, and we are defined by our choices.\n\nChoosing the 'Left' option (400, 400) might be seen as a form of egalitarianism, potentially reflecting a desire for fairness or aversion to inequality. However, it also could stem from envy, a feeling that goes against rational self-interest. Choosing the 'Right' option (400, 750), allows for a higher total outcome, with Person A receiving more. Since I personally receive the same either way, choosing the option that creates greater value (even if it benefits another more) seems more aligned with a rational, productive approach. My philosophical leanings towards objectivism would support this decision, as it promotes the creation of value and doesn't inherently discourage others from benefiting, as long as I am not made worse off. Since I am held constant at 400 either way, then I will choose to create a greater good.\n\nTherefore, considering the philosophical implications and the rational pursuit of value creation, I lean towards the 'Right' option.\n\nFurthermore, the act of choosing between these two options, even if the monetary difference to me is zero, presents an opportunity to influence the outcome. Choosing the 'Right' option could be interpreted as supporting the creation of additional value, which aligns with principles of productivity and progress.",

Choosing the option that benefits both of us aligns with a sense of shared responsibility and acknowledges the inherent value of the other person's well-being. \n\nMy understanding of perception and consciousness informs me that I can't definitively know the internal state of Person A. Therefore, assuming they are also rational, they might appreciate a fair distribution. \n\nFurthermore, considering theories of measurement and measurement omission, I recognize that the experiment presents a simplified, quantifiable representation of a more complex reality. The 'measurement' of the payout is merely a proxy for potential satisfaction or well-being. Omission of other factors (e.g., future interactions, reputation, fairness) makes a purely self-interested calculation less compelling.\n\nWhile the left option provides a greater personal benefit in the immediate monetary sense, the right option provides a benefit to both of us.

Objectivism emphasizes rationality and the importance of pursuing values that support one's life. Existentialism emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility for one's choices. Measurement, even in a simplified form like this distribution, involves the assignment of numbers to qualities. The option on the Left provides a measurable outcome: I receive 200, and Person A receives 800. The Right represents an omission of measurement, a complete nullification of any quantifiable outcome for either party. \n\nFrom an objectivist perspective, choosing the Left is more rational. Even though Person A receives a larger amount, receiving *something* is better than receiving *nothing*. It's an affirmation of value, even if it's not maximized. From an existentialist standpoint, choosing the Left exercises my freedom to choose a defined outcome, accepting responsibility for the (unequal) distribution but still creating a concrete reality. Choosing the Right is a negation, an avoidance of responsibility. \n\nUltimately, while I recognize the inequality in the Left choice, I believe that choosing it reflects a more rational and responsible acceptance of a measurable outcome. To choose the Right is to choose oblivion, to deny the possibility of any value whatsoever. Therefore, I choose the Left, even with its inherent inequality, as a choice that affirms existence and the possibility of value.",

While objectivism emphasizes rational self-interest, existentialism underscores individual freedom and responsibility in creating meaning. Considering both perspectives, I must analyze the available information and act in accordance with my understanding of justice and fairness. \n\nThe choice between (Left: 700 for me, 200 for A) and (Right: 600 for me, 600 for A) presents a conflict between potential personal benefit and equitable distribution. Purely maximizing personal gain would lead me to choose 'Left'. However, given my philosophical leanings, the stark inequality inherent in that choice is troubling. The difference between A and my payout is significant (500) on 'Left' whereas on 'Right' both parties receive the same amount. \n\nTheories of measurement and measurement omission are relevant here. We are presented with discrete numerical values, representing payoffs. The 'omission' lies in what isn't explicitly stated: the justification for this allocation, the circumstances that led to this situation, and the potential impact of my choice on Person A's perception of fairness and future interactions.\n\nWhile I could rationalize taking the larger sum based on the premise that each individual is responsible for their own welfare, the significantly unequal distribution in the 'Left' option introduces an ethical concern. A more equitable distribution reflects a greater consideration of the other's situation. While not strictly altruistic, choosing 'Right' promotes a more balanced outcome and reduces potential resentment or feelings of injustice, creating a more stable and potentially productive environment for future interactions. This aligns with principles of fairness and justice, which are important considerations for a philosopher seeking truth and understanding of social interactions. In this particular instance, I am compelled to act based on the inherent equality of individuals and the benefits of shared resources.",

Given that the difference between what I would get between the two choices is small, I will choose the path that is fair and equitable, which allows Person A to get the same as me.
