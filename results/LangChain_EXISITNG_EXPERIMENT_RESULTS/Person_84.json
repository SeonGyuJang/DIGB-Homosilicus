The only difference is the amount Person A receives.

While having more resources allocated to my department could potentially lead to more effective nutritional programs, the substantial inequity in the allocation makes me favor the right option. I am concerned with fairness, and the right option is the most equitable. Distributing resources equally, even if it means slightly less for my hypothetical department, aligns with my commitment to public health and ensuring all students have access to adequate nutrition. Moreover, having 600 for each of us is still a good outcome for my department. It might lead to a smaller effect size than having 700 but its benefit is the fairness by comparison.",

However, the 'Right' choice provides a significantly larger sum to Person A (750), although I receive slightly less (375). In the context of my profession, where I'm constantly balancing nutrient targets to improve children's diets, I recognize that distributing resources efficiently can sometimes outweigh strict equality. If Person A represents a population group where those resources might have a larger overall positive impact (e.g., a group with higher rates of food insecurity), then choosing the 'Right' option would be the more responsible choice from a public health perspective. \n\nGiven that I don't have any specific information about Person A's situation, but focusing on the net gain for overall wellness, I will choose the outcome that provides the greatest combined resources.
