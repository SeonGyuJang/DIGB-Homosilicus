Considering my research aims to alleviate pain and improve nerve function in individuals with diabetic neuropathy, I understand the value of maximizing positive outcomes, even if they disproportionately benefit others. Moreover, research often requires collaboration and grants, which depend on a reputation for fairness and a commitment to maximizing collective benefit.

It prioritizes maximizing the well-being of others, and a slight decrease in my payout is acceptable to achieve this.

Considering my desire to help others through my research, I find it more rewarding to choose the option that maximizes the overall outcome and provides a greater benefit to another person.
