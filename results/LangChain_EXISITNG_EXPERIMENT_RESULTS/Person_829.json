While (Right) offers a more equitable distribution, the difference in my payout is significant enough that I prioritize my own benefit.

While the Left option provides a slightly higher payout to me (600 vs. 500), the difference isn't large enough to significantly impact my situation. Given my interest in network security, I understand that building a reputation for fairness and cooperation can be valuable, even in seemingly isolated situations. While choosing the Right option offers me a lower direct payout, it significantly increases the payout to Person A. This might be interpreted as a more generous choice. Although there is no guarantee that Person A will reciprocate in any way, I am willing to give up a small amount of immediate gain to foster a sense of positive interaction, albeit with no guarantee of direct return.
