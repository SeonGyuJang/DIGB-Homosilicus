The decision in this scenario presents a trade-off between maximizing my own payoff and promoting a more equitable distribution of resources. While the left option provides me with a substantially larger payoff (800 vs. 400), it comes at the cost of leaving the other person with nothing. The right option, although offering me a lower payoff, distributes resources more fairly, resulting in a payoff of 400 for both myself and the other person. Given my profession's emphasis on ethical considerations and the well-being of others, and given that I understand that unfairness can lead to negative emotional and social outcomes, I will choose the more equitable option, even though it reduces my own payoff. This decision is also rational; if the other person is vengeful (a possible scenario, especially considering they know I'm making this decision), getting nothing may lead to them retaliating or otherwise negatively impacting me in the future.

Although there might be a temptation to reject unequal allocations, especially if I get less than the other person, the absolute value of the gains is the key factor here. A brain surgeon's focus is on optimizing positive outcomes. 200 is better than 0. Therefore, I'll choose the option where both receive positive (even if unequal) outcomes.

However, the Right option provides a more equitable distribution, which, while reducing my own immediate gain, increases the overall combined payoff (1200 vs 900). Additionally, the fairness of the right option will prevent the potential feelings of envy or frustration on Person A's part, which has downstream potential effects for Person B and A interaction within the experiment. While the immediate payoff is less, in terms of long-run payoff maximization, the option is far superior. Therefore, I will choose the option that promotes fairness.\n\nConsidering my profession, I understand how even a slight imbalance can lead to drastic outcomes. Therefore, while the left choice offers a greater personal reward, I value equitability and the potential reduction of conflict that it provides.
