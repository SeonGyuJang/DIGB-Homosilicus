Option Left gives me a larger personal gain (700 vs 600), while Option Right offers perfect equality. \n\nConsidering my persona, while I appreciate equality and collaboration, I am also driven by the need for resources to conduct impactful research and potentially develop new treatments for migraine. The extra 100 in option Left could be significant in terms of data collection costs, participant compensation, or purchasing materials for lab analysis.
