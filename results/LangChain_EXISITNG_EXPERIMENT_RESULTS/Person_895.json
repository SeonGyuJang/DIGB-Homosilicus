This outcome, with a total payoff, is the most effective choice.\n* **Right Choice:** Person B and Person A get 0.  This is a destructive choice that does not create any social surplus for promoting sustainable policies. This is an unacceptable outcome.\n\nGiven these considerations, maximizing overall resources available for promoting sustainable diets and resilient food systems overrides a desire for equal distribution.
