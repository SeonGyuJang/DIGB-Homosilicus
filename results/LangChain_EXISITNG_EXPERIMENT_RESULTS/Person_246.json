In this scenario, taking the option that gives both of us 400 is fair. The 400 difference between the two options is not significant enough to warrant a decision solely for personal gain. Furthermore, choosing the option that benefits both parties fosters a sense of collaboration and trust, which can be valuable in various real-world scenarios even outside of professional work.
