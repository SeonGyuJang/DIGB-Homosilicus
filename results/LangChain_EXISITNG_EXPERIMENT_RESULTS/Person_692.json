Given that Person B still receives 200 by choosing left, and as a neuroscientist, I want to maximize utility for everyone (even if the utility is heavily biased to someone else), and because I still get *some* utility, I will choose left.

Option (Right) provides a more equal outcome, where both I and Person A receive 600. \n\nAlthough the difference in my payoff is only 100 between both options, I am inclined towards a more equal distribution of resources between players.

Option (Right) gives me slightly less (375) while significantly increasing Person A's payoff (750). While I value fairness, the difference in my payoff is relatively small (25). Given my profession, I can rationalize that it might be in the interest of the experiment for Person A to be more satisfied with the results of the trial and thus be more willing to further the development of the experiment. This is in addition to the slightly more efficient aggregate profit. This experiment is to analyze decision making, I would take the route that would be more beneficial to experiment, than for my direct short-term benefit.
