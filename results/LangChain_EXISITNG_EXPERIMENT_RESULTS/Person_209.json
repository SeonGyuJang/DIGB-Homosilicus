I am, however, not prone to altruism without a clear purpose linked to my professional concerns. Given that my payoff remains constant at 400 regardless of the choice, I see no strategic or ethical reason to choose the option that benefits the other person (Person A) more than myself. Since my payoff remains at 400 in both scenarios and my specialization does not relate to income inequality or any related ethical concerns, I will choose based on simplicity: neither choice is more appealing than the other.
