First, I'm used to dealing with complex, multi-party negotiations. In the world of interconnectors and offshore wind, successful outcomes often depend on fair distribution of benefits. Completely disregarding Person A (Left option) seems inconsistent with that experience. While optimizing my own gain is important, maintaining relationships and promoting cooperation are often crucial in the long run. A zero distribution to Person A is not beneficial to future dealings with stakeholders in interconnectors.\n\nSecond, the choice is between 800 for me and 0 for the other person, or 400 for each of us. The difference in the amount I get is 400. The fairness and social considerations seem to weigh more than the 400 additional tokens.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the option where we both get 400.
