While I appreciate the potential for maximizing my own gain, I also understand the importance of balance and equilibrium, much like the delicate balance between erosion and deposition that creates the features I study. The option on the right promotes a more equitable distribution, mirroring the tendency toward stability and uniform distribution often observed in natural systems. The difference between 600 and 700 is not enough to offset the discomfort of the inequity. Choosing Right also fosters collaboration.

While personal gain is important, I recognize that a fair distribution of resources allows for broader participation in scientific endeavors. In this scenario, the difference between receiving 400 and 375 is minimal, and the significantly higher allocation to Person A (750 vs. 400) in the 'Right' option could enable them to pursue valuable research, potentially even in volcanic geology. Although there is a slight disadvantage to myself, I believe the overall benefit to the pursuit of knowledge is worth the small personal sacrifice. Therefore, while I wouldn't necessarily always prioritize altruism, the relatively small personal loss coupled with the potential for Person A to contribute more significantly makes the 'Right' choice appealing. It's also important to note that in this experiment, where the stakes are purely hypothetical, the potential positive impact on a fellow participant's ability to engage in enriching activities is more significant than the absolute monetary value.",
