I will choose to maximize the total payoff of the system to potentially incentivize Person A to behave fairly in the future, if this choice reveals my preferences.

This could be seen as selfish and could damage my credibility as a fair negotiator in future collective bargaining situations. \n\nThe 'Right' option (400 for me, 400 for Person A) offers a more equitable distribution of resources. Although it means a smaller personal gain, it aligns with the core values of fairness and cooperation, which are central to the union movement.
