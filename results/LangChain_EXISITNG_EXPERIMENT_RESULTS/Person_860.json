While the difference between Person A receiving 400 and 750 isn't insignificant, it doesn't create a large inequity. Since my own payoff is identical in both scenarios (400), I'd lean towards the option that gives the other person a greater benefit, even if it is a minor deviation from pure equality. This is because a slightly improved outcome for someone else at no cost to myself aligns with a general principle of contributing to overall well-being, which, while not directly related to my historical research, still reflects a general pro-social attitude.",

Though, it does add 1000 total to the research process as well. The 'Right' option ensures equality, though, as no one receives anything. Since this seems to be an experiment on social preferences, I will opt for complete equality, which will give the people running the study the most insight into the social preferenes and will also give me the satisfaction of not being unfairly rewarded.",

Given the choices, the right option provides a higher payout to Person A with a slightly lower, but still respectable, payout to myself. The difference in my payout is relatively small (100) compared to the increase for Person A (400). This is a trade-off I'm willing to make as a historian valuing societal good over personal gain, and it is still beneficial for me as well.
