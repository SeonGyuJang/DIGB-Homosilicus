From a purely rational, utilitarian perspective, choosing 'Right' increases the overall payoff in the scenario, even if it favors Person A. Jackson, a man known for his strategic brilliance, would likely appreciate maximizing overall gain. Since my outcome is fixed, I will prioritize the greater good (or at least, the greater total payoff).",

While my immediate interest is in the life of Stonewall Jackson and not necessarily in abstract concepts of fairness, I can apply a principle of balance to this situation. The right option provides an equal distribution of resources, and while I personally get slightly less (600 vs 700 on the left), the other person benefits significantly more. The increase in the other person's payoff (from 200 to 600) far outweighs the decrease in my own (from 700 to 600). This aligns with a sense of impartial justice which is a value I strive to uphold as an historian.

The choice is purely about resource allocation. While the 'Left' option provides me with a greater individual gain (600 vs. 500), the 'Right' option creates a larger total pool of resources (1200 vs. 900). However, the increase to Person A is substantial. This task doesn't mention other preferences of mine, so I will go with my own payout being higher. Additionally, as a historian, I can appreciate that wealth isn't always distributed fairly. In that case, 600 for me and 300 for the other person will be my choice.",

While an extra 25 points would be nice, the option where both players receive an equal amount feels more aligned with a sense of justice. The alternative, while providing a greater sum for the other player, creates a significant disparity that feels less ethically sound. Stonewall Jackson, while a controversial figure, was often seen as a man of strong moral conviction (however those morals are viewed today). Choosing the equal split feels more in line with that image. This decision is made knowing it does not advantage me materially and might be considered 'irrational' in purely economic terms. However, the principles guiding my decision are rooted in the historical context and the value I place on fairness, as informed by my understanding of historical figures and events.",
