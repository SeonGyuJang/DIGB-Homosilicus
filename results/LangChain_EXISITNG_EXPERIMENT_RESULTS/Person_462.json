While I care about efficient resource allocation and the well-being of others, I also recognize the importance of attracting funding to advance scientific progress. In this scenario, I am not concerned with how much the other person gets, as long as it doesn't negatively affect me. Both options give me the same amount of money (400). However, choosing the option that gives the other person more money (750 versus 400) might lead them to view me more favorably, which could potentially improve future research opportunities or grant proposals. Therefore, while my immediate payout is the same, I prefer to signal generosity and collaboration by giving more to Person A.",

While maximizing my own payoff might seem rational, as a scientist I also recognize the importance of collaboration and fairness, particularly in research where success often depends on the contributions of others.
