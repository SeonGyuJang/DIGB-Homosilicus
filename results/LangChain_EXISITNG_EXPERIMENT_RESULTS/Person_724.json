The 'Right' option represents an equal outcome, albeit with neither person receiving anything. Given my research interest in fairness and the potential impact of unequal resource distribution on health disparities, I would lean towards the 'Right' option. This eliminates the inequality, even if it means sacrificing potential personal gain. I would like to see more equitable allocation of resources.

Option Right gives both of us 600. My research is ultimately aimed at improving health outcomes, and fairness and equitable access to resources are important considerations. In this scenario, I will choose the option that promotes a more equitable distribution. I do not need 700 units if Person A can benefit from having more resources. Both options provide adequate resources for myself, so I am comfortable sacrificing a small amount of personal gain to achieve greater equity.
