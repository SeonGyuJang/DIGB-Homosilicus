Given my background and interest in promoting the responsible development of ocean thermal energy, I think the right choice is the equitable outcome. It helps me better work with others. The difference between the two choices is not that large, and I believe that opting for the equitable split in this single situation helps create a favorable impression of myself as someone who isn't completely self-serving.

Option Left provides a situation where resources are generated, even if they are not equally distributed. This aligns with my scientific focus on utilizing ocean resources. Option Right provides no benefit to anyone.\n\nTherefore, I will select the option that generates some resource (Left), rather than none (Right).

Option Right (375, 750) prioritizes Person A significantly, though I would still receive a substantial amount.\n\nMy scientific background pushes me to consider the greater good. While fairness is important, the potential for scientific advancement and societal benefit through ocean thermal energy requires some degree of risk-taking and resource allocation. While this experiment isn't directly tied to my research, the principles of weighing costs and benefits remain relevant.\n\nGiven the small difference in my potential payout (25 units), and the significant increase in Person A's payout, I'm willing to slightly sacrifice my own earnings to contribute to a scenario where a larger amount of resources can be potentially used to benefit a field related to my own research.
