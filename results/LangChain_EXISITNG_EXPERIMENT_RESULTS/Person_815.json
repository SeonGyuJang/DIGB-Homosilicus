Both options provide me with the same amount (400), which is critical for my company's financial stability and ability to invest in decarbonization efforts. However, the right option provides Person A with a significantly higher amount (750) compared to the left option (400). While I need to be mindful of the bottom line, I also recognize that decarbonization strategies can impact different stakeholders in different ways. Choosing the right option, while having no impact on my own earnings, demonstrates a willingness to consider the needs of others and fosters a more collaborative approach to decarbonization. This can create goodwill, potentially leading to smoother implementation and a greater buy-in from customers, the public, and regulatory bodies. From a purely financial perspective, either option is fine. However, choosing the option that demonstrably makes someone else better off without any cost to myself is the better choice. Thus, maximizing the payoff to person A makes more sense from a social welfare/image perspective.",
