If Person A's work is vital to a larger, impactful AI project that benefits many (including myself in the long run), then enabling them to succeed is a strategic move, even if the immediate payoff seems unbalanced. Furthermore, choosing 'Right' results in a lose-lose situation, contributing nothing to the broader ecosystem. Choosing 'Left' at least contributes, albeit unevenly. Although the distribution is unfavorable, the potential positive impact of Person A's resources on a larger HPC/AI initiative makes it a worthwhile choice.

My professional life often involves teamwork and collaboration, where a positive reciprocal relationship is essential.
