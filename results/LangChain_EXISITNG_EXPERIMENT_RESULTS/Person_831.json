Person A receiving 750, compared to 400, may allow them to donate a larger sum to cancer research charities. This is because Person A may be donating a percentage of their reward. Therefore, I am choosing option 'Right' to allow Person A to donate as much as possible to cancer charities. It is highly likely person A is also a participant in the cancer research area, and is in need of these funds.",

Choosing 'Right' results in zero resources for anyone, which is completely counterproductive to my goals. While I might personally prefer a more equitable distribution, the significant increase in total resources available from the 'Left' option makes it the clear choice for furthering my mission.
