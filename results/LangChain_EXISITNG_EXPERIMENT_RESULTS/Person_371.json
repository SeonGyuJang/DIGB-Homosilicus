Option (Right) results in a zero outcome for both parties.\n\n  From an ethical standpoint, creating or perpetuating inequality feels problematic, even if it benefits me to a small degree. As someone dedicated to alleviating suffering and promoting well-being, I believe choosing the option that avoids creating a large imbalance, even at the cost of personal gain, aligns better with my professional values.

I believe that equitable distribution, when possible, fosters trust and cooperation. Choosing 'Left' reinforces the importance of equality. It's also important to consider that a difference of 25 for myself is negligible in the grand scheme, but giving 350 more to Person A could enable them to have a significant impact or opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, while the scenario doesn't explicitly state the context, the equal split might be necessary for the well-being of both individuals, and any significant disparity could introduce complications or inequalities. Prioritizing overall welfare and stability seems prudent.",
