Money in this experiment is, frankly, irrelevant to my historical work.

This is not driven by altruism (though that's not *excluded*), but more by the fact that the differences are meaningless to my research. The only reason to *not* choose 'Right' would be if I had some reason to actively dislike Person A, and since I have no information about them, I have no reason to penalize them by choosing 'Left'.

Such a choice lacks the intellectual rigor and commitment to positive outcomes that I apply to my historical research. Although the disparity in wealth (200 vs. 800) might seem unfair, receiving *something* is better than receiving nothing.

Option (Right) offers a more equitable distribution, with both Person A and I receiving 600. While self-interest might initially lean towards (Left), the principles of fairness and social harmony, which resonate with the spirit of Vatican II (particularly the emphasis on solidarity and the common good as seen in *Gaudium et Spes*), weigh heavily on my decision.

The council emphasized principles of solidarity and concern for others.

Furthermore, the difference between the amounts I receive (25) is small enough that I don't mind person A receiving significantly more.
