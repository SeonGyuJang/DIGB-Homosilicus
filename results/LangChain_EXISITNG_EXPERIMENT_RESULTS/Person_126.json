While the richer option benefits Person A more, it doesn't negatively impact me. Since I value fairness and am not motivated by pure self-interest, I could choose the equal split. However, this scenario doesn't involve any historical preservation or cultural significance. Since my own payout is the same in either option, and choosing 'Right' means that 'Person A' is better off, it seems logical to choose 'Right'. Perhaps 'Person A' will use the extra funds in a way that benefits society or even historical preservation in the future.",

Choosing the option where we both receive 400 aligns better with the values I associate with the historical context I enjoy studying.

Option Right provides Person A with 750, which is significantly more than option Left. The reduction in my own payoff (375 vs 400) is relatively small compared to the benefit given to Person A.
