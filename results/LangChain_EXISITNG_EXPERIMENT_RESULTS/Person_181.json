Although I might not maximize my individual gain, promoting fairness and cooperation can lead to better outcomes and foster trust, which is essential in scientific collaboration and societal progress. Therefore, I will choose the 'Right' option, valuing fairness over pure self-interest in this scenario. The fact that A gets 0 seems unfair, even if I'm maximizing my pay off with the Left choice.

Option Right results in a zero outcome for both of us. While the distribution is unequal, Option Left represents a Pareto improvement, as both individuals are better off compared to Option Right. From an ethical standpoint, maximizing overall welfare seems reasonable. From a game-theoretic perspective, if A thinks I will choose left because it is better, A will be happy.
