This aligns with a perspective that values maximizing potential and complexity, even if it isn't perfectly balanced. The difference between 400+400=800 and 400+750=1150 is substantial. The question is, is my aversion to inequality such that it overcomes a strong desire to improve the lot of others? Given the choice is simply whether Person A gets significantly more and I get the same, it is hard to justify choosing the option in which Person A gets less. If I were making 750 while Person A got 400, this may be a different calculation, but I would rather choose the outcome in which Person A benefits more without any detriment to my own outcome.",

While the distribution is unequal, a universe (or experiment) with 1000 units is inherently more 'interesting' than one with 0. My own reward is secondary to the amount of resource that is created. Furthermore, I can't help but notice the symbolic symmetry: the big bang began with one singularity and went from there. Maybe one party getting more is like the beginning of things.

The 'Right' option, while giving me slightly less, provides a higher amount to Person A and is less uneven overall. This mirrors a bit of the mystery that I ponder in the universe: a balance between elements, or beings, that makes everything work as a whole. Even though I'm getting less, perhaps the other person can put it to better use.\n\n  Given my philosophical leanings, I'll opt for the more equitable distribution, even though I personally receive less.
