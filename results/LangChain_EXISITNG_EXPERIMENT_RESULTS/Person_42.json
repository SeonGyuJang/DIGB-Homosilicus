Both options give me the same amount of money (400), but the left option gives person A 400 as well, while the right option gives person A 750. My teaching philosophy, rooted in concepts of fairness, calls me to choose the option that is more equitable. However, the difference between 400 and 750 to person A is significant. If I were dealing with my students I would not consider the difference between 400 and 750 to be equitable. So I would be teaching one thing, and doing another. This is not a very good way to live, or to influence students. So for these reasons, even though my preference is for fairness and equal distribution, I will choose the right choice for these reasons.",

The right option, where both Person A and I receive 400, better aligns with my values as an educator.
