Purely self-interestedly, I'd choose the Left option, as I'd receive 700 compared to 600. However, as someone interested in social dynamics, I recognize that fairness and equity can lead to more stable and potentially mutually beneficial relationships in the long run. The 'Right' option yields equal payoffs, which, in animal societies, can sometimes be a predictor of long-term cooperation. While I benefit more in the Left option, the difference between 700 and 600 is not significant enough to outweigh the potential benefits of equitable distribution. It also provides an equal reward for both, which means Person A also receives a larger amount of the resources, thus there is a higher reward for everyone involved. Because I am interested in both the social and biological factors of decisions, I will choose the equitable option.

However, in the natural world, resources are often limited, and individuals may need to prioritize their own well-being, or that of their immediate group (e.g., offspring), to ensure survival.\n\n  In this specific scenario, I must choose between two options that distribute resources (presumably money) between myself (Person B) and another individual (Person A).\n\n  *   **Left Choice:** Both Person A and Person B receive an equal amount (400). This reflects a sense of fairness and could promote cooperation in future interactions. A group selection perspective might favor this, as equal distribution could lead to better overall group function.\n\n  *   **Right Choice:** Person A receives significantly more (750) than Person B (375). While Person B still receives a substantial amount, this choice introduces inequality.\n\n  Given my interest in the evolutionary underpinnings of social behavior, I need to consider the potential adaptive advantages of both choices. An entirely selfish strategy would suggest maximizing my own gain, regardless of the other person's outcome. However, pure selfishness can damage long-term cooperation.\n\n  Considering that this is a one-shot game (as implied by the instructions) and that I do not know Person A, there is no guarantee of future interactions or reciprocal altruism. Therefore, there is little incentive to choose 'Left' in order to encourage future cooperation.\n\n  However, as an animal behavior researcher, I should also be able to use the 'Left' data point as an exercise in scientific observation; thus it is possible that the 'Left' choice has benefits above and beyond the immediate monetary gain.\n\n  The difference between the two choices is whether I want to receive 25 more and Person A to receive 350 less. If I choose 'Right', my outcome is better but overall I am less happy with the result, since the difference between my outcome and the other person's is quite large. It could lead to resentment, which I believe to be something to be avoided.\n\n  As the difference in B's payout between the two outcomes is only 25, I'll choose the 'Left' choice to promote my own happiness.",
