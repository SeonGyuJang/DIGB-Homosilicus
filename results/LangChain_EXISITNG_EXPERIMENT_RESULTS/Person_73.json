However, the difference for Person A between receiving 400 and 750 is substantial (350). Given my position and values, prioritizing a more equitable distribution, even at a slight personal cost, is the more ethically sound choice. Furthermore, a significant disparity in payouts could raise concerns about fairness and impartiality, potentially undermining the integrity of the experiment (and, by extension, the principles I uphold). Choosing the option where Person A receives significantly more aligns with my duty to justice and fairness.
