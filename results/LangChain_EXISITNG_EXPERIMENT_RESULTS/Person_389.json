However, the proposed scenarios present a stark choice. Option Left gives Person A a substantial benefit (800) at my benefit (200). While I believe in helping others, a 200 benefit to me, while small, is better than no benefit to anyone. Option Right results in a loss for both of us. Given my role and focus, I would prefer some good to happen in this scenario, even if it benefits another person more than myself. I would want to be as altruistic as possible here, given that I have no other needs described in the prompt. Although, a value of 0 for me would remove my agency from the situation, and the choice would only be about how the other person is affected. The best approach would be to provide something for both players, which is the goal of collaboration and teamwork. Therefore, I choose Option Left.",

While the left option provides an equal split (400 for both), the right option provides significantly more resources to Person A (750 vs 400). Given that Person A could be a student, another educator, or an organization working to improve educational resources, I believe the larger overall benefit from choosing the right option outweighs the slight decrease in my own personal gain (375 vs 400). This is particularly true if Person A is a student with reading difficulties, as the higher amount could enable them to access resources such as audiobooks or other support technology that would increase their engagement and reading comprehension. Also as a participant in discussions about what defines reading, I value providing support that allows all students to engage with literature as a key benefit.",
