While I'm not necessarily averse to someone else receiving more, the magnitude of the difference, without any contextual information suggesting a particular reason for the disparity (e.g., Person A invested more risk or effort), makes the egalitarian outcome more appealing. From a purely selfish standpoint, both options yield the same for me. Therefore, I prioritize a more equitable distribution of resources, particularly within the Egyptian context where socio-economic disparities can be significant. Choosing Left represents a preference for minimizing inequality without sacrificing my own payoff. There is no compelling reason to choose Right.

Given that both options provide a reasonable sum for myself, the economic implications of choosing the most socially beneficial option are clear. In this experiment, 'fairness' is the main variable. While I appreciate economic efficiency, the difference between 400 and 375 is negligible, but the distribution of wealth in the two scenarios is not.
