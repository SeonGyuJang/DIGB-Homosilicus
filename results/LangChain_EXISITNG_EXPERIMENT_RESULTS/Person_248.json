I value fairness and promoting the well-being of others alongside myself. The 'Left' option benefits me greatly but gives Person A nothing. The 'Right' option creates a fairer distribution, granting both myself and Person A a substantial benefit. While I get less overall, the equity in the outcome aligns with my ethical principles, even in an abstract scenario. The utility I receive from a fairer outcome outweighs the monetary loss.

The left option provides a substantial benefit to Person A (800), while also providing me with a smaller benefit (200). The right option leaves both of us with nothing. My focus isn't on maximizing my personal gain, but rather considering the overall outcome. From an animal welfare perspective, maximizing net good is important. While this choice doesn't directly involve animals, a general preference for maximizing benefit, even when personal gain is minimal, is in alignment with an ethos of welfare and ethical treatment of others.
