A healthy ecosystem requires a certain degree of balance and equity in resource distribution. While this experiment doesn't directly relate to marine ecosystems, the principle of balanced distribution resonates with me. \n\nThe left option gives me more (700 vs 600), but Person A gets significantly less (200 vs 600). The right option offers a much more equitable distribution (600 each). Although I would receive slightly less for myself, the outcome is fairer. My research focuses on creatures which are themselves often overlooked or undervalued. The better outcome for A would better reflect what i do. Therefore, I choose the right option to promote a more equitable outcome, reflecting my values as a scientist focused on balance in ecological systems.",
