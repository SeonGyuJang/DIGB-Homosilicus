Choosing 'Left' creates a Pareto improvement, where at least one person is better off (me) and no one is worse off. Rejecting the offer, as would happen with the 'Right' choice, would be purely destructive. While the allocation isn't perfectly equitable, it still represents a net positive outcome. It is rational to accept a positive gain, even if another person benefits more from that gain, when the alternative is that both parties receive nothing. Furthermore, declining might be interpreted as spiteful or irrational and go against professional principles focused on contributing towards beneficial outcomes. While there is inequality, rejecting such a gain contradicts principles of promoting positive outcomes.",

As an FDA official, a degree of impartiality is necessary. I do not have specific information about the person A and therefore cannot make a decision predicated on their health.
