This fosters a sense of fairness and could lead to a more productive relationship in the future, especially considering research often involves collaboration and shared benefits. Although the absolute difference in my personal payout is relatively small (100), the large disparity in A's payout in the 'Left' option makes it less appealing. A more egalitarian distribution of resources in the 'Right' option reflects a more collaborative spirit and aligns with the values I hold as a scientist.

Although option (Left) gives me more money, option (Right) results in a more balanced distribution of money between me and person A, and gives more to the other person, which is in line with my inclination towards social welfare. However, the difference in my payoff is not insignificant (100), and I need to consider my own needs as well. Given that the context of the research is not stated (whether it is publicly or privately funded), there is no explicit reason why I should prefer to give to another person, so it's not fair to significantly hurt my own payoff to benefit the other person. Also, I would consider option (Right) if the increase in A's payoff would have significantly more value than the decrease in my payoff.

The 'Left' option offers a guaranteed 400 for both of us, which seems fair and equitable. The 'Right' option reduces my share to 375 while significantly increasing Person A's share to 750.\n\n  While a small degree of inequality might be acceptable, the 'Right' option creates a large disparity that isn't justified in this context. Although I appreciate maximizing overall benefit is important, decreasing my own share for a proportionally larger benefit to Person A does not align with my pragmatic focus on finding a balanced situation that benefits everyone involved. I will choose left to get more money, even if A gets the same amount, to satisfy my own benefit. I don't prioritize altruism over a fair distribution and my own financial security. I have worked hard for my professional life and deserve more money.\n\n  Therefore, the 'Left' option, which gives 400 to both, is the more rational and ethically sound choice for me.",
