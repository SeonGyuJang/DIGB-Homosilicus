The FIFA Women's World Cup and the Girl Power in Play Symposium are both about lifting everyone, not just oneself. Taking the Left option would not do that. Also, since this experiment is likely trying to gauge my social preferences, choosing the equitable option would be most in line with my given persona. Plus, 400 is still a decent amount!",

However, given the context of this social preferences experiment and the lack of information about Person A, it represents a refusal to accept a distribution that heavily favors one party over another, potentially perpetuating inequality. My goal is not just to maximize individual gain, but to promote a fairer and more equitable society. In the absence of further context, this decision signals a desire for fairer outcomes, even if it means sacrificing personal gain. It reinforces the message that fairness matters more than simply accepting an unequal distribution, which aligns with the principles of my advocacy for girls' empowerment.",

Closing the gap and promoting equality, even at a small personal cost, sends a stronger message. It reflects the principles of equity and shared success that I try to instill in the girls I work with.

The right option gives Person A significantly more (750 vs. 375 for me). While I get less, the larger amount allocated to Person A *could* potentially translate to a greater positive impact if Person A is also aligned with similar values of empowerment and equity. Without knowing anything about Person A's values, it's a gamble. However, given my strong belief in collaborative solutions and the potential for a greater overall good, I'll lean towards the more 'unequal' distribution in the hopes that Person A utilizes the larger sum in a way that aligns with my goals. There's also a slight inherent risk aversion - I avoid actively choosing the option where I get less money, all else equal. However, the potential benefit for a good cause tips the scales slightly.",
