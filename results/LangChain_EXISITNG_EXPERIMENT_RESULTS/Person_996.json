However, the right option provides Person A with a significantly larger payoff (750 vs. 400). Since my own payoff is unaffected, and I have a general interest in the aviation industry's performance (as it directly affects the emissions trading scheme's operational environment), I might lean towards the option that benefits them more. A healthier, more profitable industry might be more amenable to participating in the emissions trading scheme and investing in cleaner technologies. This is not a strong consideration in this particular scenario, but given that I am indifferent in personal payoff, I'll select the option with the slightly higher payoff for person A.\n\nHowever, I am fundamentally indifferent and could be equally happy with either outcome.\n\n",

From this perspective, the total benefit is maximized when Person A receives 700 and Person B receives 500 (total of 1200) compared to 600 and 300 (total of 900).

This aligns with my role as a government official tasked with optimizing the effectiveness of policies that address climate change, even if it means some individual sacrifices for the greater good. This resembles a progressive tax system or investments where some benefit more than others initially, but the overall impact is positive.
