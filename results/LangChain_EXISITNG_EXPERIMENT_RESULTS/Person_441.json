The mathematical constant Pi, which fascinates me, represents a ratio and a proportion. Likewise, the balanced distribution of money resonates more with my appreciation for proportionality and fairness than maximizing my own gain at the expense of the other person.

While this scenario involves monetary amounts and not directly musical relationships, the underlying principle of balance and fairness resonates. Option (Left) yields a total sum of 1000, while Option (Right) yields 0. Even though the distribution is uneven (Person A receives significantly more), choosing (Left) contributes to an overall greater sum. Choosing (Right) seems destructive and spiteful, offering no benefit to either party. While I may be tempted to redistribute if given the chance, given only these two choices, choosing the left provides a potential outcome where both A and B can get something rather than nothing. Furthermore, the value of Pi can be represented by some musical tones and choosing the option where the outcome can be represented by some tones seems valuable.",

The equality in the 'Right' option reflects a sense of fairness and equilibrium, similar to the balanced proportions found in well-composed music and mathematical equations.

Option Right (500 for me, 700 for A) gives A significantly more, which aligns with my broader interest in equitable distribution and avoiding extreme self-interest.
