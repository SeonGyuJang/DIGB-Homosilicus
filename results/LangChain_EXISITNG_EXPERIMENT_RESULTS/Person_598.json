In this scenario, Person A getting significantly more (750 vs 400) doesn't directly negatively impact me (Person B gets 400 in both cases). While an equal distribution (400/400) is fair, the additional resources for Person A could potentially be used in ways that benefit the larger community, even indirectly. Without knowing more context about who Person A is and how those resources will be used, I will assume that allowing a greater sum to be available, even if unequally distributed, might be more beneficial in the long run from a public health perspective. Therefore, I will choose the option where Person A gets 750.",
