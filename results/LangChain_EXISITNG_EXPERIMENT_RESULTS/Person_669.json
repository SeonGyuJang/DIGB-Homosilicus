The difference in payout to Person A is not directly relevant to my research, as my focus is on the individual experience of Person B. Both options provide Person B with the same outcome of 400. While the altruistic impulse to maximize the overall payoff might be considered, in this scenario, both choices are acceptable from a strictly rational, self-interested perspective. Given that my persona is not explicitly oriented towards altruism, and that the study context is unclear, I'll choose the option that maintains the greatest degree of predictability and avoids potential biases that might arise from considering the other player's outcome. I don't have information suggesting there are any downstream consequences from either choice. Therefore, I can arbitrarily pick one. Given the nature of my profession, if there was some information asymmetry between the two allocations I'd be more likely to prefer the allocation that doesn't have hidden information so that I don't accidentally make assumptions about the information asymmetry. However, the question does not suggest information asymmetry and, instead, suggests an equal allocation for Person B, so I will simply randomly pick one.",

While traditional economic models often assume self-interest, research in social preferences reveals that factors such as fairness, altruism, and inequity aversion play a significant role.\n\n  In this scenario, the choice is between two options:\n\n  *   **Left:** I receive 200, and the other person receives 800. This represents an unequal distribution, significantly favoring the other person.\n  *   **Right:** Both I and the other person receive 0.\n\n  From a purely self-interested perspective, choosing 'Left' is superior since I get 200 rather than nothing. However, my research emphasizes the role of hormones and the brain in mediating emotional responses, including aversion to inequity. While I'm not driven solely by altruism, the large difference in outcomes (200 vs 800) is a concern.\n\n  Given my profession, I value data and understanding how people make decisions in such circumstances. A purely rational economic actor might choose Left, but research on social preferences indicates many people would not.\n\n  Considering the context of social preference experiments, and reflecting on my own potential aversion to inequality (which my research explores), I'm drawn toward choosing 'Right'. Although I would gain 200 with 'Left', the inequitable outcome might induce discomfort and dissatisfaction. However, as a scientist, I also consider the potential information I could gain from a larger sample population choosing 'Left'. While I don't want to assume that people will always prefer equality, in this specific case, I'm more inclined to choose 'Right'. This isn't based on a strong moral conviction, but rather a combination of potential inequity aversion and a desire to not contribute to a highly unequal outcome.\n\n  However, after reflecting more and considering the potential for regret in choosing an option where I lose out entirely, I lean back towards choosing the option where I obtain a small amount of utility. It is important to remember that while hormones and behavior shape my inclination toward altruism, I also have inherent self-preservation mechanisms that would drive me to choose 'Left'.\n\n  Therefore, although I am swayed by the potentially inequitable outcomes, I ultimately decide to choose the option that provides me with some utility.",

But, that comes at the expense of reducing both the overall payout and my partner's payoff. \n\nAs a researcher, I need to consider the bigger picture. Given the slightly lower amount I receive in Option (Right), the fact that the combined payout is significantly larger, and the higher payoff for Person A in Option (Right), I will select Option (Right). Doing so would provide the group with the highest sum of earnings, showing that, overall, I chose an option that increased the total resources available.

However, from an experimental perspective, it doesn't offer much insight into how an individual weighs fairness against personal gain.\n\nOption Right (375, 750) creates an unequal distribution, where Person A receives significantly more than Person B. Choosing this option, even though it slightly decreases my own monetary reward, could be interpreted as a form of 'inequity aversion' or a willingness to sacrifice a small amount to avoid a large disparity. However, it also has to do with the magnitude of the sacrifice. If I chose Left, Person A gets the same as I do. If I choose Right, Person A gets nearly double what I get. My sacrifice of 25 points is far outweighed by the benefit gained by Person A. Thus, I will choose Right. \n\nGiven my research interests and the context of this experiment (Barc2), I hypothesize that Person B is more likely to care about the other person's outcome than maximize their own.
