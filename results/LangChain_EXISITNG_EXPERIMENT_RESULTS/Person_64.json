Although a significant disparity exists in the Left option, I'd prefer that some value is generated rather than none at all. Moreover, as a scientist, I understand that resource allocation and optimization can be complex, and that perfectly fair distribution isn't always achievable in real-world scenarios.

In this scenario, 'fairness' is a desirable 'property'. Since the total payoff in the equal distribution is much higher, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of my personal gain to ensure a fairer and more efficient outcome.

The Right option results in a significantly higher payment for Person A (750 compared to 400).
