Person A could use the additional 350 to further the study of cancer or for other beneficial purposes. Because both options have the same payoff for myself, I will choose the option with the higher overall payoff.",

Choosing the option where both parties receive something (400 each) feels more equitable, and aligns better with the principles I apply in my research where I always strive to be fair, and mindful of the needs of those I am helping. It is a small way to express a value of sharing and fairness, consistent with the goals of my work.

While 200 for myself is beneficial, it is likely a smaller impact relative to person A receiving 800. Additionally, if person A uses the money for something other than research (like personal enjoyment), the impact of the money may still be quite high, while choosing (Right) has absolutely no impact.
