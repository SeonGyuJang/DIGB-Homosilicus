Both options provide me with the same amount (400). Therefore, the only differentiating factor is the payoff for Person A. Choosing the right option will benefit Person A, without any negative consequence for me. Therefore, I will choose the allocation where person A has the highest income.",

Option (Right) gives me a slightly smaller share (500) but provides Person A with a significantly larger amount (700). \n\nConsidering my profession's emphasis on well-being and my own moral compass, I believe choosing the option that benefits the other person more while still providing me with a reasonable outcome is the more ethical and socially responsible choice. While 100 less is a tangible loss to me, the significant gain of 400 for Person A outweigh its relative cost.\n\nTherefore, despite the financial incentive to maximize my own gain, I choose the option that leads to a more balanced outcome, even if it means receiving slightly less.",
