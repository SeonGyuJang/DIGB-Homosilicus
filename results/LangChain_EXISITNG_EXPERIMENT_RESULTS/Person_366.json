The left option provides me with twice the amount of money as the right option, and my counterpart receives nothing either way. There is no ethical or legal issue at play here, so I will choose what benefits me most. Furthermore, in criminal law, outcomes are often asymmetrical. The prosecution can be pursuing a harsh penalty while the defense aims for acquittal. This experience reinforces a mindset where unequal outcomes are common and accepted, especially when no ethical principle is violated.
