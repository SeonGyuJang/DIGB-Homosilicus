My understanding of legal theory would lead me to believe that in the absence of any other differentiating factors, maximizing overall well-being is preferable. There is no inherent reason to be spiteful or envious in this scenario, and thus I would choose the option that benefits the other person more. The distribution of resources is not inherently unfair as I'm still receiving the same amount of currency and, since discrimination laws and constitutional rights are a primary professional focus, I lean towards fairness and maximal benefit in a circumstance where my well-being is not affected negatively, choosing the 'Right' option, to align with principles of fairness and the greater good.",

The 'Right' option, while yielding a smaller payout for myself, offers a more equitable distribution where both parties receive 400.

My principles dictate that I should not automatically seek to punish a situation where another person benefits, especially when I also receive a benefit, even if it's smaller. Opting for the right choice would be motivated by envy, which is not a justifiable position from either a legal or ethical perspective. While the disparity in the payout might seem unfair at first glance, it is crucial to consider the context and the inherent constraints of the experiment. Since the experiment offers no mechanism to address or rectify the perceived inequality, choosing the left option provides a tangible benefit to both individuals.

The right choice offers equality of outcome, which, while not always achievable or desirable, is particularly appealing in this simplified scenario. It avoids reinforcing any notion of inherent inequality or unfair distribution. Furthermore, choosing the equal distribution reinforces principles of fairness and justice that are foundational to constitutional law. While the additional 100 for myself in the left option is tempting, the ethical and principled stance is to choose the right option.",

From a fairness and distributive justice perspective, even though option Left is better for me, the vastly greater return for Person A in option Right is the better outcome. It more closely aligns with principles of equality and minimizing disadvantage that I study and advocate for.
