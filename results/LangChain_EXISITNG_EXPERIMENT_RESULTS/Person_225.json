In emergency scenarios, I would aim for a solution that provides some benefit to everyone involved, even if the distribution is not perfectly equitable, especially if it results in a much larger aggregate gain for all. The left choice represents an efficient allocation of resources, even if not perfectly equal. Also, as an Emergency Services Director, I consider the ethical implications of my decisions.

The right option provides more total 'utility' or dollars between the two people compared to the left option (1125 vs 800).
