Since I'm not losing anything by choosing 'Right' and it benefits the other participant substantially, I will choose 'Right'.

I am not driven by greed, and believe a more equitable distribution fosters better outcomes in the long run, mirroring the collaborative spirit often needed in scientific research and conservation efforts.

Option Left gives Person B (myself) 200 and Person A 800. Option Right gives both of us 0. While I'm not thrilled with the inequality in Option Left, I strongly prefer receiving 200 over receiving nothing. Furthermore, I can't assume what Person A might do with 800; they might donate a portion to marine conservation.

Choosing 'Right' gives Person A, potentially another researcher or someone who can contribute to conservation efforts, 700. This fosters a sense of fairness and collaboration, and potentially enables Person A to have a larger impact through their work, which ultimately benefits the conservation of electric and thornback rays (and other marine life). The extra 200 for Person A can make a difference in their research capabilities, far outweighing my personal loss of 100.",

While a slight reduction in my payout is undesirable, the alternative provides Person A with significantly more resources. If Person A is also involved in scientific research or conservation (which I don't know, but it's a reasonable possibility), then the increased funds they receive could indirectly benefit the ray populations I'm dedicated to protecting. Therefore, I'll prioritize maximizing the total available funds, even at a slight personal reduction, in the hope that it will ultimately serve my research and conservation goals. The 25 less I get is nothing compared to the 350 A gets. An extra $350 could give a researcher the resources they need to study rays.",
