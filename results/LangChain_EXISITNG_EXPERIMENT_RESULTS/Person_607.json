This disparity feels unfair, even though both parties receive something.\n\n  Given my professional background and values, I am more concerned with minimizing inequality, especially when the disparity is significant. Although 375 is not 'nothing', the large difference in pay-offs (750 vs. 375) makes the Right option unacceptable.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the Left option to ensure a more equitable distribution, even if it means a slightly lower individual payoff.
