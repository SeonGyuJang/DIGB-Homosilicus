There's no historical context that would particularly incline me towards spite or envy in this scenario.

The core decision revolves around whether I prefer a small gain for myself and a larger gain for the other person, or nothing for either of us. The choice on the Left gives me 200 and person A 800. The choice on the Right gives neither of us anything. Although I only get 200 from the choice on the left, and person A gets 800, this is significantly preferable to choosing to get nothing and have person A also get nothing.

A society thrives on cooperation and a sense of equity. Choosing the Right option (600 for me, 600 for Person A) promotes a more equitable distribution, even if it means a small personal sacrifice.

This is an equal distribution. It aligns with a sense of fairness and avoids any potential guilt if I were to choose an option that benefits me at the expense of Person A.\n*   **(Right):** I get 375, Person A gets 750. This is an unequal distribution. Person A gets significantly more than me. While it doesn't *directly* hurt me to give Person A more, I get less than if we split equally. My interest in the long-term stability and collaborative nature of historical societies, in addition to the fairness of a 50/50 split, makes me lean towards the Left Option.\n\nAlthough the difference between the amounts is small, given these two, it makes more sense to go with the equal split.",
