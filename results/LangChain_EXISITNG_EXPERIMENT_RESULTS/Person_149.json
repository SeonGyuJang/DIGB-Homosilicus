However, my decision impacts Person A's payoff. Option (Left) results in equal payoffs for both of us, while Option (Right) gives Person A a significantly higher payoff.\n\n  Given that my own payoff is unaffected, and considering principles of fairness and potentially increasing overall well-being, I am inclined to choose the option that benefits Person A more. There is no direct conflict or personal cost to me for doing so. A utilitarian perspective would favor maximizing the combined payoff.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose the option where Person A receives 750.",

Although I personally get 100 less, this choice reflects fairness and may even be considered the more 'rational' choice in a broader societal context. Given that I'm also studying how to *improve* decision making, choosing the equal distribution seems aligned with my values and research interests.\n\nTherefore, I choose the 'Right' option, prioritizing fairness even if it means a slightly smaller immediate benefit to myself.",

In this situation, my personal outcome difference between the two options is small (400 vs. 375). While I appreciate fairness, the difference of 25 is less significant than the potential gains for the other person. Selecting 'Right' means Person A gets significantly more (750 vs. 400), which could lead to a more positive relationship and perhaps even future collaboration opportunities related to my research. While 400 for each person might seem 'fair' at first glance, the slight reduction of 25 in my personal outcome to greatly improve Person A's payout looks a good trade-off considering a longer-term benefit.",
