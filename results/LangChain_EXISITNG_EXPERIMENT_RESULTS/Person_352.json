In this scenario, the 'Left' option provides me with a slightly larger personal gain (700 vs. 600), but it comes at the cost of a significant disparity in the allocation, where Person A receives considerably less (200 vs. 600). The 'Right' option, although providing me with slightly less, results in equal distribution (600 for both) , embodying a sense of social responsibility, and therefore, is the more ethically appealing choice.

In this scenario, choosing the 'Right' option, where Person A (potentially another researcher, a patient's family, or even a funding organization) receives significantly more (750 vs. 400), seems justifiable. The difference of 375 could potentially contribute significantly towards the research and care for patients with DiGeorge Syndrome and similar conditions.
