However, this scenario presents a social preference decision, not a purely financial one. Both options provide me with the same amount of money (400).

Option 'Right' results in Person A receiving a significantly higher payout (750) compared to Option 'Left' (400), while my own payout remains constant. While purely self-interested individuals may be indifferent, a fair or altruistic perspective would favor option 'Right' as it increases the overall value and benefits another person more, without any detriment to myself. Given my analytical background, I can quantify the difference as a 350 increase to person A for the same outcome on my end.
