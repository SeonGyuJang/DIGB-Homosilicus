Both choices give me the same amount (400), so my decision hinges on what happens to Person A. The right choice gives Person A significantly more (750 vs 400). While pure self-interest wouldn't influence my choice as I get the same amount either way, a slight preference for fairness and maximizing total benefit would nudge me towards the right option. Also, as a researcher I value the importance of cooperative results so I'm prone to select the result with higher overall payoff for both involved. Since my payoff remains constant, it is optimal for me to select the higher payoff for person A.",

The right option (400 for me, 400 for the other person) provides a more equitable outcome where both parties benefit. While I get less overall, the increase in equality aligns with a sense of fairness that I believe would improve the overall outcome. The details of this experiment don't allow me to contribute beyond the immediate monetary outcome, so I will choose the more fair outcome.",

Choosing 'Right' means a slight decrease in my own payoff (500), but a considerable increase in Person A's payoff (700). Given that the difference between my payoff options is relatively small compared to the difference in Person A's payoff, and given my inclination towards fair resource allocation, I will choose the option that provides the higher payoff for Person A, even at a slight personal cost.
