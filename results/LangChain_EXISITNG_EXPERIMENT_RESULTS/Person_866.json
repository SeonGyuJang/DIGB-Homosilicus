From a utilitarian perspective, maximizing the total welfare is preferable. Furthermore, I am open to some inequality if it means I benefit. While a perfectly equitable distribution would be ideal, receiving 200 instead of 0, even with the disparity, is a better outcome. Therefore, I will choose option Left.",

While I would be giving up 100 units, the increased fairness and the positive impact on the other participant outweighs the small personal loss.
