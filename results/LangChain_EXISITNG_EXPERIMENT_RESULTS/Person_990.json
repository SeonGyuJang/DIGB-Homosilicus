Given my dedication to improving the quality of life for patients and believing in a slightly more equitable distribution, I choose the 'Right' option.

This aligns with my values of prioritizing patient-centered care and improving overall welfare, even if it means a slight personal reduction. Because I am passionate about patient-centered care and improving the quality of life, and because option Right gives significantly more to another person at minimal cost to myself, I choose Right.
