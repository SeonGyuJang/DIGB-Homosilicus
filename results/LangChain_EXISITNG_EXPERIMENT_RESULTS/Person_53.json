I am content with the outcome in both scenarios and since I am not in need of additional funds, I would rather select the option that promotes equality between participants.

The Right option provides a more equitable distribution, even though it means a smaller personal gain. Given my appreciation for balanced ecosystems and recognizing the inherent value in collaboration, I lean towards the more equitable outcome, even if it's not the individually maximizing choice.

I find the idea of Person A getting four times what I get particularly off-putting, even though I still get something. The alternative, the 'Right' option, ensures equality, even if that equality means neither of us gets anything. While I'd prefer we both gained, the lack of fairness in the 'Left' choice is enough to sway me toward mutual nullification. I am okay choosing the Right choice, as both actors are equals now.",

Option Right (500 for me, 700 for A) creates a more equitable distribution, even though I personally receive slightly less.

However, choosing the 'Right' option results in Person A receiving significantly more (750) compared to the 'Left' option (400). \n\nGiven my persona, I lean towards a slight preference for the option that maximizes the overall benefit, even if it creates some inequality.
