My specialization is rather niche, so collaborative opportunities might be useful for future research. If choosing the option which benefits both me and another is a sign of collaboration, I will choose that. Since the choice does not affect my 400 tokens I will select the fair choice. ",

My research also often involves collaboration and sharing of knowledge, reinforcing the idea of equitable benefit.

It feels unfairly skewed. Though I don't know anything about Person A, the inequity in the left choice is too great. Choosing the Right option, even though it yields nothing for either of us, feels more aligned with fairness.

The choice on the Right, where both Person A and I receive 600, represents a more just distribution of resources.

Option 'Right' gives me 375 but gives person A 750. While I lose 25 in Option 'Right', Person A gains 350 in Option 'Right' compared to 'Left'. Given my background and the somewhat small sum of money involved, the altruistic choice of maximizing overall benefit seems preferable. The difference of 350 to person A is significant, and the loss of 25 to me is minimal. Therefore, I will choose the option that benefits the other person more.
