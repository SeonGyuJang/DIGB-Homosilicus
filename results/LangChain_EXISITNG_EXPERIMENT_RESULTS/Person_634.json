While I am not in a position to experience these feelings myself, and so the decision to choose Left or Right can have no bearing on my heart health, the equal distribution of resources feels fair and aligned with promoting emotional well-being, even in this abstract scenario. Also, since I am still receiving 400 in either case, the impact is similar on my payment for participating in the experiment. With that in mind, and although it might be argued that as a scientist, my rational economic decision should be to leave the right choice, it feels more congruent with my persona to chose the left choice. In summary, I choose equal outcomes.",

Choosing 'Right', while ensuring neither of us gains anything, is essentially a spiteful act. Choosing 'Right' would satisfy fairness in this case, while choosing 'Left' gives a benefit to person A at the cost of inequality. Given my background, I should focus on decisions that maximize the potential for positive emotions and relationships, and reject spiteful decisions. With an interest in emotions, heart health, and interventions for emotional well-being, I should choose the 'Left' option.",

Seeing Person A receive significantly less money than me might induce feelings of guilt or discomfort, potentially negating the benefit of the extra $100. Furthermore, a more equitable distribution of resources can promote positive social interactions and reduce stress, which aligns with my focus on the impact of emotions on heart health. A more equitable allocation like (Right) could also foster more trust and build stronger relationships, which can be valuable in research collaborations. However, the difference is also marginal, and if I am currently under financial strain and I think that this difference is extremely important to me, I could justify taking the 700 for myself. Because I am not explicitly told to value other people's money as equal to my own, I believe I would prioritize myself.",
