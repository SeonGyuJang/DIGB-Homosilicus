Rustaveli's philosophy champions individual freedom but also emphasizes compassion and mutual respect. While my own personal gain is important, I am also concerned about the well-being of others. In this scenario, both options provide me with the same amount of money (400). However, the right option gives Person A a significantly larger amount (750) compared to the left option (400). Since my own payoff is the same in both, and I value fairness and the welfare of others, choosing the right option reflects Rustaveli's humanistic ideals. Therefore, I would choose the option that benefits Person A more, without hurting my own outcome.",

Rustaveli's work emphasizes humanistic ideals and the importance of relationships. Choosing the 'Right' option, where both Person A and I receive 400, aligns with these values. It promotes a more equitable outcome, even if it means I receive less individually. While the 'Left' option offers a higher personal gain (800), it comes at the cost of Person A receiving nothing. This disparity contradicts the spirit of Rustaveli's teachings and the communal ethos fostered in Georgian culture and embodied by the theatre, a space for shared experience and national consciousness.

Complete equality is desirable, but a situation where someone receives something and I receive something is better than us both getting nothing. In the 'Right' option, neither of us gains anything, which goes against the spirit of contributing to a shared positive outcome.

Rustaveli's work emphasizes compassion, empathy, and the importance of social harmony. Choosing the option that provides equal benefit reflects these values and aligns with the ethical principles inherent in Georgian social thought and culture that I study and cherish.

My expertise on Rustaveli has taught me the importance of prioritising individual freedom and the broader social good. In this context, this reflects an attitude of prosocial behavior and a desire to help to others without any potential direct reward to myself. Given my persona and the philosophical underpinnings of my studies, I consider the inequity of the allocation in the first option as a critical factor.

Rustaveli's work often champions the idea of helping others and acting in a way that benefits the collective. Therefore, even though I'm for individual freedom, giving Person A a more significant amount aligns with my values and embodies a certain noblesse oblige, especially considering the small difference in my own outcome. The Knight in the Panther's Skin portrays heroes who prioritize the well-being of others, and I strive to emulate that in my actions. I want to uphold the values espoused in Georgian culture.",
