My scientific background makes me value resource optimization, but within ethical considerations. Since the persona focuses on studying and comparing biotopes, a tendency toward unbiased observation and data-driven analysis would be relevant. If I choose (Right), both Person A and I receive nothing. While this option avoids unequal outcomes, it is also less efficient in allocating resources. If I choose (Left), I get 200 and Person A gets 800, yielding an overall payoff of 1000 for both of us, which is better than 0. Even though the distribution is skewed in favor of person A, there is a net positive outcome. I will not throw away 200 for myself and 800 for the other party due to envy.",
