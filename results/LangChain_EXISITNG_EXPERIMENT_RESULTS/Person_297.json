While I am generally averse to inequitable outcomes, in this scenario, the difference between the two options is not significant enough to override the slight preference for receiving more resources. Both options provide me with the same amount (400). Choosing the right option results in Person A receiving a significantly higher amount (750 vs 400), which does not directly harm me and, arguably, could be justified given the complexities of resource distribution, particularly in legal and immigration contexts where inherent power imbalances exist. Given my research interests in how laws are designed and who benefits, I'm less concerned with perfect equality in this one-off transaction, and more with the broader systems that create inequality.

However, the difference is not so stark that I would actively penalize myself significantly. This is a one-shot game, so considerations like reputation and future collaboration are not relevant. Although the Right option would lead to a more unequal outcome, it does not penalize Person B significantly.
