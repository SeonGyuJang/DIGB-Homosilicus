The 'Right' option leaves everyone with nothing. Given my professional commitment to improving lives and the fact that this isn't a real world patient interaction, choosing the Left option guarantees some benefit for both parties, which is more in line with my general philosophy of promoting positive outcomes.

This option creates a large inequality. While I receive more, Person A's outcome is significantly lower.\n\nOption Right: I get 600, Person A gets 600. This option promotes equality and fairness.
