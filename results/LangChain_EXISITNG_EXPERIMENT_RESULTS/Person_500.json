While the 'Right' option gives Person A a higher payoff, both options offer me the same amount (400). Given my values, I will choose the option that results in a more equitable distribution of the gains. Since both options give me the same amount, I'm indifferent based on the monetary outcome alone. However, because I don't know Person A, I'll slightly favor a fair outcome. Therefore, the choice 'Left' seems appropriate. If there were a way to know Person A and leverage the 'Right' option for a future opportunity related to careers in STEM, that would be a more nuanced consideration. But absent that knowledge, I lean towards the fairer distribution.",

Choosing the left option, while giving Person A a significantly larger share, fosters goodwill and opens possibilities for future collaborations that could ultimately benefit my students and my career-linked curriculum initiatives.

A more financially empowered Person A might lead to better resources, expanded programs, or enhanced STEM events like the Big Bang North West. Given my interest in collaboration and learning from experienced educators, fostering a positive and mutually beneficial relationship is a key consideration. The increased benefit for Person A potentially outweighs the minor decrease for me, contributing to a potentially more impactful STEM education community in the long run.
