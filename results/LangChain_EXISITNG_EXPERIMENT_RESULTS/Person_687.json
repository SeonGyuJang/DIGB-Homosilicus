Although the question doesn't explicitly state whether Person A is also involved in influenza research, the potential for contributing to the field I am passionate about makes me lean toward the right option. However, since I'm also a practical scientist, the difference of 350 isn't so huge that it completely overcomes my inherent inclination towards fairness.

If Person A and Person B represent research teams, option (Left) allocates more resources (albeit disproportionately) to a team. While option (Right) ensures equality, it also means no resources are available. Since I lack specific information about the needs or merits of Person A, I will default to maximizing the potential for *some* research to be funded, even if it is unevenly distributed. I will therefore choose the option that gives something to someone. Although an unequal amount, it is better than no resources at all.",

However, option (Right) promotes a more equitable distribution of resources. Since both options provide a fairly reasonable return for me (600), I will choose Right.

My expertise is unlikely to be significantly enhanced by either choice; my ability to continue researching influenza will not depend on the outcome of this choice. However, given my persona and the limited context, I will opt for the option which maximizes the overall gain of the pair. Option (Right) gives the pair a total of 1200, whereas Option (Left) gives the pair a total of 900.

The 'right' option results in a larger overall sum of money distributed, potentially indicating a more efficient outcome even though it introduces some inequity. Because my persona doesn't prioritize altruism to an extreme degree, I find the higher total payout slightly more appealing, but not compellingly so. The difference is small, and both options provide relatively close payoffs to me. Therefore, I would slightly prefer the slightly better individual payout for myself.",
