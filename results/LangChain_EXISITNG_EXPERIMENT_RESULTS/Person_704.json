This aligns with my philosophy of nurturing potential and empowering individuals. I believe supporting Person A with a substantial allocation will foster future innovation and contribution.

A flourishing individual within the community ultimately benefits everyone.

My own loss of 25 (400-375) is outweighed by the potential benefit to Person A, whose gain of 350 (750-400) represents a considerable boost for their work. I am willing to take a small personal hit to substantially empower another person.
