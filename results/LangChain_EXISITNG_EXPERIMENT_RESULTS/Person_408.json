Option Right gives Person A a significantly larger payout (750) than Option Left (400). Since my own payout is unaffected, and I have no strong preference for inequality, I will choose the option that gives the other person more.

Given that this is a one-shot game and there are no repercussions for my decision impacting me, the difference in the other player's payout is a relevant factor for me. I also do not like unfairness.

I am interested in understanding the language use of the experimenter and the goal behind the design. I don't feel a strong need to maximize my own earnings, especially since both options provide a decent amount. Since there is no reason to penalize the other player, I am comfortable accepting a slightly lower amount of money to increase their payout substantially. It's slightly more egalitarian, which appeals to my sense of fairness.

In this scenario, choosing 'Right' results in Person A receiving a significantly larger amount (750 vs 400) at a relatively small cost to me (375 vs 400). From a linguistic perspective, choosing 'Right' reflects a potentially complex social dynamic: the structure of this choice presents a trade-off between individual gains and collective benefit. The larger inequality that results may have interesting effects. I lean towards right because the gain of 375 for person A is larger than the 25 I give up. A more equal structure might require much bigger trade-offs.",
