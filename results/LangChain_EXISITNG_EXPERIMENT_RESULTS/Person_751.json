While the right option promotes equal allocation, my field of nanotechnology focuses on pushing boundaries and achieving ambitious outcomes.

As such, to pick the Right option because the allocation is unequal is irrational and also reduces the total benefit to both individuals.

My research often involves collaboration and sharing resources, so I am inclined to prefer outcomes that benefit everyone involved, within reason.
