Choosing 'Left' creates 1000 of value that can potentially be redistributed or utilized for conservation efforts in a future scenario. Choosing 'Right' destroys that potential. While the payoff isn't equitable, it's better than nothing. I'm willing to accept the lower payoff to ensure that a positive return is achieved for both players and that some welfare is maximized.

While I personally receive less (500 vs 600), the other person gets significantly more (700 vs 300), making the total higher. From a societal perspective, it would be more important to select Option 'Right' as it leads to a better outcome overall. Although, my research interests would point me towards understanding the implications of different payoff schemes for long-term resource use. I do not know if Person A is directly involved in the fishery, and it may be unfair to select a response that benefits them if they are damaging the fisheries.\n\nDespite the decrease in personal income for Option 'Right,' my understanding of optimal fisheries size would point to it as a useful choice.",
