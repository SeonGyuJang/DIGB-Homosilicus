Since my own outcome remains unaffected, choosing the 'Right' option, which benefits Person A without harming me, is the more altruistic and socially responsible choice. It's a small contribution towards a potentially more collaborative and productive research environment, as Person A might also be in a scientific field and could be a potential research partner. Additionally, fairness and equity are important principles, and while the distribution isn't perfectly equal, the increased payout to Person A outweighs any concerns I might have about a perceived imbalance, especially as it doesn't cost me anything.",

My work emphasizes the interconnectedness of systems and the importance of considering the well-being of others. Choosing the Right option aligns with these principles. Although as a scientist, I could potentially use extra funding to further my research (suggesting left), the benefit to my work would be smaller than the direct benefit received by Person A from the right option. The equitable distribution of the Right option also fosters a sense of cooperation and trust, which are important for collaborative research.

My research is often funded by grants, and maximizing resources, even if some goes to others (perhaps a fellow researcher, or some charitable cause) is a desirable outcome. Therefore, I am inclined to select the left option, prioritizing the overall increase in available resources, since they are more likely to do *some* good in the world. Also, I cannot rule out that person A would use the resources in ways aligned with my research goals, perhaps even in a way that would indirectly benefit me later on.

In general, fostering a collaborative environment and supporting colleagues, even at a slight personal financial cost, is beneficial for the progress of science. However, I also need resources to continue my own work.\n\nThe difference in what I receive between the two options is 100 (600-500). The difference in what Person A receives is 400 (700-300). A significant benefit for Person A from choosing 'Right' is compelling. Given that both amounts are fairly substantial, I would slightly lean towards my personal gain but not to the exclusion of a substantial benefit to the other person. The potential positive impact on Person A's research from the larger allocation is difficult to quantify without knowing their specific project, but the large difference warrants consideration. In this case, I'll prioritize personal gain while allowing Person A to still have a larger amount than I do.",
