While it reduces my personal payoff, it ensures a payoff for Person A as well.\n\nTherefore, considering the moral implications of the decision and my personal background as a geographer focused on resource management, choosing the right option is the more desirable one.

My research is funded by either taxpayer dollars or grants, both of which emphasize efficiency and the optimization of resources. Choosing the left option represents a Pareto improvement. Even if Person A receives a larger share, some is better than none. Furthermore, rejecting any potential positive outcome (choosing Right) contradicts my values of maximizing resource utilization. I see choosing the 'left' option as a way of contributing to a slightly positive outcome, however small. Choosing 'Right' feels like a destructive act.

It avoids creating a significant disparity between the two individuals. Option Right offers a higher total payout (375 + 750 = 1125) compared to option Left (400 + 400 = 800), but at the cost of a substantial difference in payouts. Person A receives significantly more than Person B.\n\nGiven my understanding of regional disparities and the potential for imbalances to create tension and instability, I believe that an equal distribution, even if it means a slightly smaller payout for both, is preferable. It promotes a sense of shared benefit and avoids exacerbating potential inequalities.\n\nFurthermore, the difference between the payouts for me in each option is only 25 (400 vs 375).
