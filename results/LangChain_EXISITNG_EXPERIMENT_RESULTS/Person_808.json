While I am not inherently altruistic, I recognize that the 'left' option can foster a perception of fairness and perhaps even establish a future beneficial relationship with Person A (even if not directly). Furthermore, I am driven by success, which inherently means taking calculated risks and leveraging opportunities, even if the direct personal financial benefit is less in comparison to the other person's. Zero profit is not a strategy Pulitzer would make. Given my background in building newspapers from the ground up, I prefer the potential, however slim, for future opportunities and good will instead of an outright loss. This outweighs the pure monetary difference, as a good relationship can make up for more money in the future. I am more motivated by the fact I could make 200 when otherwise I would get nothing.",
