There's no justification, even from a classically 'right-wing' perspective of individual liberty and limited intervention, to actively choose the outcome where someone else receives less. While my knowledge of Catholic theology might encourage a focus on charitable works, in this context it serves to reinforce the idea of helping others without hurting myself.

However, even with nuance, this situation is interesting. The \"Left\" choice maximizes my individual gain, aligning with a potentially right-wing emphasis on individual achievement or potentially left-wing emphasis on acquiring resources to redistribute later. The \"Right\" choice prioritizes a more egalitarian outcome, which is traditionally associated with left-wing ideals, but can also be associated with certain right-wing concepts of communitarianism and noblesse oblige, especially within a religious framework.\n\nConsidering my persona is knowledgeable about contemporary Catholic theology, I would likely lean towards the \"Right\" option. Catholic social teaching emphasizes solidarity, subsidiarity, and the common good. While individual initiative is valued, it's balanced with a responsibility to others. Leaving Person A with nothing would be difficult to reconcile with these principles. Contemporary Popes, especially Pope Francis, have stressed a preferential option for the poor and marginalized.\n\nGiven the specific numbers (800 vs. 400), the equal split offered by the \"Right\" choice is particularly appealing from a Catholic social teaching perspective.

The terminology is loaded. 'Left' and 'Right' originated during the French Revolution, referring to where different factions sat in the National Assembly. Over time, they've become shorthand for a cluster of beliefs â€“ the 'Left' often associated with egalitarianism, social justice, and government intervention; the 'Right' with tradition, individual liberty, and limited government. Modern usage is, of course, far more complex. Moreover, my knowledge of contemporary Catholic theology and its development suggests a concern for both social justice and the common good, a tension that could pull me in either direction. \n\nHowever, in the cold light of game theory, and given the inherently artificial nature of this experiment, I'm inclined to prioritize fairness, but with a small 'boost' for myself. The 'Right' option offers perfect equality: 600 for me and 600 for Person A. The 'Left' option has me getting more (700) but Person A gets less (200). If this was about real-world resource allocation or policy, a more nuanced ethical consideration would be required. But given the limited context and the experiment's focus, I will err on the side of relative egalitarianism. It's the 'least bad' option. I will avoid the more blatantly unfair choice. I will choose 'Right', but it feels dirty, given the inherent reductionism of these terms in the first place.\n",

Choosing the 'Right' option, although it means a smaller personal gain, demonstrates a commitment to the well-being of others, aligning with the principles of solidarity and charity central to Catholic thought and the broader egalitarian ideals often associated with the 'left'. Although I am not prioritizing Person A in the strictest sense, I am willing to slightly reduce my gain to create a more equitable outcome, and give them some value in the experiment.\n",

The 'Right' option, while giving a smaller amount to me (375), gives a significantly larger amount to Person A (750). This creates an unequal distribution, which, at first glance, might be seen as leaning towards a 'right-wing' perspective valuing individual gain over equal distribution. However, as someone familiar with Catholic theology, I also consider the concept of 'subsidiarity,' which suggests that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level. In this context, allowing Person A to potentially benefit more might be a decision that reflects subsidiarity in that they are better placed to use those resources to benefit themselves and perhaps, others. In addition, while I would be making slightly less in the 'Right' choice, the overall financial benefit to those involved is higher, reflecting a capitalist approach to economic gain. In this situation, the difference between 400 and 375 is not significant enough to cause inequality aversion to override my willingness to help maximize economic prosperity overall. The 'Right' option appears to reflect the capitalist underpinnings of modern day right-wing politics more accurately than 'Left' embodies the true values of the left.",
