Since my own payout is the same, I see no reason to choose Left, as it would be spiteful to deny Person A more money without any benefit to myself. In the context of a collaborative discussion perhaps, there might be some expectation that the money will benefit the experiment and I would like to see more resources made available to help in later rounds and discussions.",

Option (Left) gives me a significantly larger reward (800) while giving nothing to Person A. Option (Right) offers a smaller reward to me (400) but also gives an equal amount to Person A (400). While I appreciate the potential for spot cooling offered by vortex tubes, in this decision, efficiency is still important, but fairness also plays a part. In this specific, anonymized situation, choosing (Right) seems like the more reasonable thing to do; giving a reward to myself and person A equally is more reasonable than maximizing my personal gain while providing nothing to person A.
