Option (Right) creates a more equitable distribution of the payoff, with both Person A and I receiving 600. \n\nWhile SDB offers great cost saving opportunities, it's important that the technology is used responsibly and doesn't undermine fair compensation. By selecting the option that results in a more equal distribution of pay (Right), I'm promoting fairness and collaboration, which are important values in my field. This approach ensures a more sustainable and ethical implementation of SDB and similar technologies.\n\nFurthermore, choosing Right demonstrates a commitment to fairness that could lead to better collaboration and trust in future professional interactions. This is especially important in fields like coastal surveying, where teamwork and data sharing are often essential. \n\nTherefore, considering the potential benefits of fairness and collaboration and with the understanding that a difference of 100 is minimal given the larger sums, the right choice is to pursue a more equitable distribution.",
