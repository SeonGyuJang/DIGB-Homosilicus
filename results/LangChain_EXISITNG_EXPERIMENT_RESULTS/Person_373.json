In the context of research, collaboration and shared resources are crucial. Contributing to a scenario where Person A also benefits might foster a more collaborative environment and potentially lead to future research opportunities or shared knowledge that ultimately benefits my own work and the advancement of plant-based medicine.

In this scenario, while the left option provides an equal split (400 for each person), the right option actually increases the total resources available (375+750=1125 vs 400+400=800). Although I personally receive a slightly lower amount with the right option (375 vs 400), the other participant receives significantly more (750 vs 400). Given my focus on research and collaboration, a potentially happier and better-resourced collaborator could benefit both of us in the long run. Additionally, I'm not driven by spite or envy. I believe in maximizing the collective good, even if it means a slightly smaller individual gain. The difference between 400 and 375 is not large enough for me to choose the left option.
