A more equitable distribution (Right) promotes a collaborative environment where both parties benefit significantly. In the long run, such an environment fosters innovation and knowledge sharing, which are essential for advancing automation and robotics technologies. While 100 more for me sounds good, 400 more for A sounds like a better distribution overall.

While Person A gets more in the 'Right' option, the marginal utility of the additional 350 for them is unlikely to significantly impact my own goals relating to automation or learning. Since the difference in my payoff is so small, and there's no clear benefit to me from A getting more, I'll choose the option that benefits me slightly more, even if the difference is marginal. In this scenario, my focus is primarily on optimizing my own outcomes, as the experiment does not involve direct collaboration or shared projects where Person A's wellbeing might benefit me in the long run.",
