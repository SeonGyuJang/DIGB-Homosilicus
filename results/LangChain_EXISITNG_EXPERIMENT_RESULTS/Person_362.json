While the 'Left' option provides me with a slightly higher amount (700), it comes at the cost of significantly reducing Person A's allocation (200). I believe that the overall benefit of having both parties receive a substantial amount outweighs the personal gain of an extra 100. This is consistent with my compassionate approach to care, where I prioritize the overall well-being of others, not just myself. As a dermatologist, I am accustomed to making decisions that require balancing individual benefits with potential harm or disparities, and I believe that, in this case, choosing the option that promotes a more equal distribution of resources aligns with my professional ethics and personal values.

Even though it is in my personal best interest to pick left, the right option increases the overall money received by both players, while still ensuring that I would receive a large sum.
