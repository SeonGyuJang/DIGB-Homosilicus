This suggests a better overall outcome for the team (or research community).

Choosing the 'Left' option provides resources (albeit primarily to Person A). I'd rather see research funds, even if mostly directed elsewhere, than have no funds at all. Choosing the 'Right' option would mean a loss of resources that could potentially support or foster research in the broader scientific community. I am willing to forgo a potential personal gain (200) to promote more overall resources to potentially be used by the research community. This is a social preferences experiment, and therefore my decision needs to consider others' well-being and scientific progress. While getting something is better than nothing from a purely self-interested perspective, from a scientific progress perspective giving away most of the money is better than nothing. Because this experiment does not involve me in a collaborative or personal relationship, a simple choice for scientific progress is the best option.",
