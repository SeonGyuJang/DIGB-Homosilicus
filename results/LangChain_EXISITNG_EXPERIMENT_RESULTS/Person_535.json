The first option presents a significant disparity (200 vs. 800) which I find to be unfavorable.

Although I personally receive slightly less (600 instead of 700), Person A receives a substantial increase (600 instead of 200). From a societal perspective, the total gain is 1200 in both scenarios, but the distribution is far more favorable in the 'Right' option.
