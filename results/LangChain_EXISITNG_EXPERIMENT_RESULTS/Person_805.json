Choosing (400, 750) allows Person A to receive a significantly higher payoff while not negatively impacting my own outcome. While profit is important, building strong relationships and a reputation for being a reliable partner in hazardous waste management can lead to more business in the long run. From a business perspective, the slight increase in payoff for Person A is not enough to trigger envy or a feeling of unfairness. Choosing Right projects fairness, and has little to no impact on me as a company.",
