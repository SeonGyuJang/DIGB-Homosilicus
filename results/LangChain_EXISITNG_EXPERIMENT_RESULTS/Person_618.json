However, the right option gives Person A significantly more (750 versus 400). Given my past experiences and commitment to saving lives and fighting oppression, I believe in uplifting others whenever possible. While I might have preferred an even split, the fact that I still receive 400 in either choice makes the right option, benefiting Person A more, the better outcome.

While 375 is a respectable amount for myself, the 750 for Person A suggests a potential disparity or inequity. I don't know the full context, but the imbalance prompts me to favor the 'Left' option. This option guarantees both Person A and myself receive an equal and fair amount (400 each). Equality and a rejection of potential inequity outweigh the slightly lower personal gain in this scenario. My history has taught me that solidarity and fairness are more crucial than individual enrichment, particularly when the circumstances surrounding potential disparities are unclear.",
