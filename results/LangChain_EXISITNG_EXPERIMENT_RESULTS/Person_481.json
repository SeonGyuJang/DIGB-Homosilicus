The 'Right' option, with equal distribution (600 vs 600), offers a sense of fairness and stability. My interest in sago palms suggests a preference for careful cultivation and managed outcomes. This aligns better with an equitable distribution. I prioritize this equitable outcome slightly over the extra 100 I could receive in the Left condition.
