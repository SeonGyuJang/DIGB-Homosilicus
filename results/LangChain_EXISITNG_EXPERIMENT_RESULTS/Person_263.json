While 400 for each person in the Left option seems 'fair' in a simple sense, the difference between 375 and 400 for myself is relatively small compared to the increase given to the other person with the Right option (375). Although the difference is notable, the additional utility enjoyed by the other person is likely to be more than my loss. My interest lies in the broader impact of information and knowledge sharing, and that impact would be greater with additional money given to another individual than to myself.
