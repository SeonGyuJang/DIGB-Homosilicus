The right option gives Person A a significantly higher payoff with no loss to me.

This maximizes my individual gain. Option (Right) gives me 400 and Person A gets 400. This is a fairer distribution.\n\nAlthough I appreciate fairness, in this limited context and without further information about Person A or the broader implications, maximizing my own payoff seems like the most rational choice. Furthermore, in a real-world project, I could use the extra resources (the extra 400) to benefit the whole team, including Person A, indirectly.\n\nHowever, there's a strong argument for choosing the equitable split to foster positive relationships with collaborators, especially in a field dependent on teamwork.

I approach this like an engineering trade-off. While I personally would appreciate the 200, the larger benefit for Person A is much more important.
