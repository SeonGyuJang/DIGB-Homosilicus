Option (Left) leads to a Pareto inefficient outcome where Person B gets 200 and person A gets 800 while the right option has zero to both sides. Option left is the better option as it benefits at least one participant. Since the sum of money with the left outcome is 1000 while the sum with the right option is 0, option left is the more socially efficient option, so it is the natural choice to pick.",

The choice on the right creates an equal distribution, which aligns with my preference for fairness. Although, as a climate scientist, I am used to having to make decisions that weigh the long term good vs the short term gain, I think that the most important aspect of the decision is that Person A is getting a fair amount of money, I would never want my scientific values to impact my financial decision.

However, given the large difference in payoffs, I will consider whether I will prioritize equity (the left) or try to maximize overall payoff (the right).
