While I understand this experiment may gauge for altruism or inequality aversion, my ethical principles lead me to choose the outcome that benefits someone else more, given my own benefit remains constant. This aligns with my commitment to positive outcomes in general, a principle that guides my views on animal research too. Therefore, I will choose the right option, even though it does not increase my direct benefit.

While I believe in contributing to society and not being purely self-interested, I also recognize that earning resources allows me to better contribute to my field and animal welfare. The left option provides me with resources without directly harming anyone. The right option results in nothing for either person. Given my persona's belief in maximizing overall benefit and considering the absence of any harm to animals or ethical considerations in this specific scenario, I should choose the option that benefits me and also gives something to Person A, even if it isn't as much.

I would choose the option that reduces the disparity in payoffs, even if it means a slightly lower outcome for myself.
