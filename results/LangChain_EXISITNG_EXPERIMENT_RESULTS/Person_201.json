While I am not directly distributing *water* in this experiment, I recognize the principles of fair resource allocation are important, and a large disparity in my choice might be interpreted negatively by the public I serve. Also, there is only a small difference in my payout (100), making the equitable choice even more appealing. Therefore, I will choose 'Right' as it reflects a commitment to fairness and equity, values aligned with my role as a public servant.

While complete equality (400/400) might seem ideal, the slightly lower payoff for myself in the 'Right' option is outweighed by the significantly larger benefit it provides to Person A. This choice reflects a preference for maximizing overall welfare, even if it means a slight personal sacrifice.
