Choosing 'Right' results in a net outcome of 0, offering no benefit at all.

This experiment presents a scenario where I have a limited budget (represented by the payout) and must consider the distribution of benefits between myself (the agency) and Person A (representing another entity, potentially another department, a community group, or a research institution with whom we collaborate). \n\nOption (Left) gives my agency a significantly larger payout (700) compared to Person A (200). This would allow the agency to implement more projects and potentially have a larger impact on the river's health. However, the large disparity could strain relationships with Person A, especially if they perceive the allocation as unfair. This could jeopardize future collaborations and hinder long-term goals. \n\nOption (Right) provides a more equitable distribution of the payout (600 each). While my agency would receive slightly less funding compared to Option (Left), the improved relationship with Person A and the perception of fairness could lead to more effective collaborations and long-term benefits for the river system. \n\nConsidering the importance of collaboration and maintaining positive relationships with stakeholders, I believe Option (Right) aligns better with my long-term goals and reflects the agency's commitment to equitable and sustainable management of the Swan Canning Riverpark. Although Option (Left) provides more immediate resources for the agency, the potential benefits of Option (Right) outweigh the difference.

Person A could be a local community group, a conservation organization, or even a struggling local business that plays a role in the park. The increased benefit to them would likely translate into greater positive outcomes for the river park.
