From an efficiency perspective, the 'Right' option is arguably 'better', even though both outcomes are zero.

The Right option offers a better sense of fairness, where both parties receive a relatively significant amount, and Person A even gets slightly more. While I would get 100 less, my background leads me to prefer a slightly more equitable outcome, fostering potential collaboration and positive relationships in the future.

I am slightly more interested in the total outcome and my own outcome; as long as I get a fair amount, the overall sum is more important than whether the outcome is equal. I am not overly concerned with the slight inequality and will thus choose to get 375 instead of 400 and give the other player 750. This may slightly improve efficiency, although to be fair, efficiency isn't what's primarily important.\n\n  Therefore, I will pick the right choice, resulting in a slight improvement to the total money but at my own expense of 25.
