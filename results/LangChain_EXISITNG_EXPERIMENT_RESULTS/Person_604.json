I am more concerned with the cultural richness and stability of a society that produced such vibrant music. However, in this specific scenario, where my own payoff remains constant, there is no material impact on my ability to continue my research and preservation efforts. I can support cultural activities if Person A also benefits with no harm on me. Hence, I'd lean towards maximizing the overall resources available, even if the distribution isn't perfectly equal. Perhaps Person A will use their larger share to contribute to a local culture initiative, furthering the spirit of Marosszék region! The increase of the overall payment is worth more that the fairness in this case.",

The equal distribution offered by the right choice, while slightly less personally lucrative, aligns better with my values of fairness and community, reflecting the communal spirit often found in the folk music traditions I study. It's a more 'harmonious' choice, if you will. Furthermore, the difference between 700 and 600 is relatively small compared to the difference between 200 and 600.",
