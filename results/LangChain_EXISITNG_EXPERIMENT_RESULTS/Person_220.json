Option (Left) gives Person B more (600) compared to Person A (300).\n\n  From a purely altruistic perspective, I might lean towards (Right), maximizing the benefit to Person A, though it lowers my own payoff. However, from a research ethics perspective, where fairness and minimizing harm are paramount, I might lean toward (Left), to ensure both A and B have an okay payout.\n\n  Given the absence of further information about the context of 'Barc8' and a slight preference for not overly prioritizing others above oneself (consistent with the research environment's need for self-advocacy to secure funding, etc.), I will choose the Left option as it still provides a reasonable amount to Person A while maximizing my own.\n\n  I also consider the possibility that repeated interactions or a larger game context might exist within 'Barc8'.
