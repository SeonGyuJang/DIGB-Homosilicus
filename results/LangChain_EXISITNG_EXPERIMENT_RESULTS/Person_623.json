While the experiment focuses on social preferences, my personal philosophy prioritizes a baseline of fairness and well-being for myself. In this specific scenario, the choice is between a very unequal distribution (200 for me, 800 for Person A) and mutual zero payoff. The first option provides me with a positive outcome, while the second option avoids reinforcing a significant wealth disparity. While equality is not specifically a medical or health concept, a large discrepancy in income (or in this case, 'points') can create stress and anxiety, negatively impacting cardiovascular health. Although the 200 is smaller than what Person A receives, the fact that it is a positive amount suggests a better path than mutual destruction. Therefore, I choose 'Left'.",

However, the 'Right' option provides a much more equitable distribution of resources, with both Person A and I receiving the same amount (600). This equitable distribution aligns with my values, potentially leading to less stress and fostering a sense of community, which, in turn, can contribute positively to overall health, including cardiovascular health. The small sacrifice in my individual payout seems worth it for the larger social benefit of equality. Additionally, a fairer outcome could contribute to a more positive and collaborative environment for research into health and wellness, indirectly benefiting my area of interest.

Option (Right) results in a larger overall payout (500+700 = 1200 vs 600+300 = 900) and, while it gives me slightly less, it significantly benefits Person A. From a utilitarian perspective, maximizing overall well-being is often a desirable outcome, even if it means a small personal sacrifice. Furthermore, since I value research and data, I should be consistent and consider the experimental setting itself as providing information and perhaps implicit ethical demands. In this situation, promoting a more equal outcome and increasing overall welfare seems most aligned with my values and my background.",

This aligns with a utilitarian perspective, aiming to maximize overall benefit. Moreover, seeing the other person receive significantly more might even motivate them to further contribute to health research. The relatively small difference between 400 and 375 to me compared to the 400->750 jump for the other person is too important to pass up. I believe that the overall improvement in welfare across both people will offset the minor disadvantage to myself.",
