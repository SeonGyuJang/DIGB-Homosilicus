The advancement of science often requires prioritizing resources to those who can best utilize them for the benefit of society as a whole.

Therefore, while I don't know who Person A is or what their needs are, I don't have a strong reason to punish them (or myself). While the distribution in 'Left' is unequal, the overall outcome is better for both individuals. I would prefer us both to benefit, even if I benefit less.

My decision should be based on what provides the *most* information about how people, including myself, make choices in these situations. Therefore, it makes sense to consider the potential signaling I am sending to Person A. Choosing 'Right' signals a degree of altruism or fairness, as Person A receives more money. Choosing 'Left' signals a self-interested approach. Both strategies are scientifically valid, and given the context of a purely hypothetical situation, neither has implications to the progression of my genetic research. \n\nTherefore, to avoid signaling pure self-interest and perhaps promote potential future collaboration opportunities if the experiment's results were somehow made known (even indirectly and anonymously), I will choose 'Right'. This also allows me to compare my behavior to others choosing the same way. While the marginal difference in my own payout isn't large, I believe it's important to act consistently with generally perceived ethical principles, as I will need to uphold high ethical standards in my genetic research.",
