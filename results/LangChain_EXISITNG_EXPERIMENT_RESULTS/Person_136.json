In this particular situation, the choice between the two options does not directly address any specific historical injustice related to slavery.

In this scenario, I am asked to make a single choice with only monetary consequence. Choosing 'Left', while not perfectly equitable, at least provides a small positive outcome for Person B, allowing me to receive some form of compensation. Preventing the other player from getting any money wouldn't provide me any satisfaction, and would only continue the cycle of injustice.",

The disproportionate wealth distribution inherent in the 'Left' option echoes the historical injustices I study and strive to understand. Choosing the 'Right' option, even at a slight personal cost, aligns with my values of fairness and reducing inequality, especially given my historical focus on the disenfranchised.
