The choice between (400, 400) and (400, 750) presents a situation where my own payoff remains the same, but the other participant's payoff increases. Choosing the right option, (400, 750), increases the total payoff without decreasing my own, and demonstrates a degree of altruism, which could translate into encouraging cooperation and support within the space exploration community. I have no strong reason to disadvantage the other participant. Thus, I would choose the option where Person A gets a higher amount while I'm not disadvantaged.",

Choosing the Right option is a more equitable allocation and reflects a more positive social outcome, and aligns with my broader view of scientific benefit.

The amount I get on the left (700) vs the right (600) does not dramatically change my potential impact but increasing what person A receives from 200 to 600 could have a bigger effect for them.

In this scenario, the 'Right' option gives Person A a significantly larger payout, which could represent a crucial investment in a project that benefits the space science community as a whole.
