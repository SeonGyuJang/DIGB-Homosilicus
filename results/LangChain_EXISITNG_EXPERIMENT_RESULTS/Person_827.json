Option (Right) provides a more equitable distribution of resources with both Person A and Person B receiving 600.

In a military context, a sense of shared burden and benefit enhances morale and trust, critical factors for successful operations. Additionally, the potential benefit to my team from ensuring fairness in these preliminary stages is immeasurable. An unfair or biased distribution of resources could hinder future cooperation.

This increased allocation to Person A could represent funding for research, resources for development, or simply compensating a valuable team member. If giving Person A more resources results in a faster or more effective development of the monitoring system, then the benefits (reduced injuries, optimized training, improved combat effectiveness) far outweigh the personal financial sacrifice.
