The potential impact on digestive health, even indirectly, is something I consider. Choosing the 'Right' option where both receive nothing avoids contributing to a system where resources are not distributed justly. It is important to note that neither option is good. Since nothing is mentioned about the conditions or needs of Person A. I would be OK to accept a 1:1 scenario, or a 2:1 scenario where Person A would obtain 2 units for my one.

A healthier society, in my view, is one where resources are distributed more fairly, leading to less stress and potentially better overall health outcomes for both individuals. Although I could personally benefit more from choosing left, the difference isn't significant enough to outweigh the ethical consideration of fairness.

Option (Right) provides a greater overall total (500+700 = 1200) than Option (Left) (600+300 = 900). While I personally get slightly less, Person A gets significantly more, resulting in a bigger 'pie' overall. This reflects my values in a way, where maximizing resource utilization benefits everyone. The difference isn't large enough for me to feel deprived or that I am being taken advantage of. However, I also value fairness and am sensitive to unequal distributions.
