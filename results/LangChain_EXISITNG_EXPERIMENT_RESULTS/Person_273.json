The 'Right' option, while giving me slightly less, creates a more equitable distribution. While my tech focus doesn't directly dictate ethical choices, the inherent logic of optimization often aligns with fair resource allocation. The difference in what I receive is only 100, while the difference to Person A is 400. I choose the option that increases overall happiness/satisfaction, assuming Person A will be significantly more happy with 600 rather than 200.

In the context of processor performance, this resembles optimizing for throughput or overall system performance, even if it means a slight reduction in individual core performance.
