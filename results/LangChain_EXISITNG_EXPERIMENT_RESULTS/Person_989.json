Therefore, I will choose the right option. The term parapet comes from the Italian 'parapetto', meaning 'breast high wall', used for protection on fortifications.

Though a fortification builder at times, not everything needs to be fortified.\n\nGiven my interest in structures, and that structures should provide stability, equal is the best way to go. There is risk that the other person may take advantage of having more. It is safer to have a parapet in this case.\n\nTherefore, I lean towards the Left option, prioritizing equality and avoiding any potential negative ramifications arising from a perceived imbalance in favor of Person A.
