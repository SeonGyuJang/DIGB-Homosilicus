This mirrors some of the issues I see in San Francisco development, where certain entities benefit disproportionately while others are left behind. While getting 200 is better than nothing, the vast disparity feels unfair. It contributes to a system where large imbalances persist.\n\n  Choosing 'Right' results in neither of us receiving anything. In the short term, it's a loss for both. However, it also avoids perpetuating a skewed distribution. It reflects a rejection of a system where one person benefits massively at the apparent expense of another (or at least with a significantly smaller share). In the context of urban planning, this might represent rejecting a proposal that greatly benefits a developer while providing minimal community benefit.\n\n  Given my strong values around equity and fairness, I am inclined to choose 'Right', even if it means neither of us gets anything.
