The first option, giving both me and Person A 400, establishes a situation of equal division, reflecting a basic understanding of justice. However, the second option provides Person A with a significantly larger sum (750), while maintaining my own share at 400. While some might view the equal distribution as more immediately aligning with justice, the Quran also promotes kindness and giving to others when able. Choosing the option that benefits Person A more, without diminishing my own share, aligns with the principle of 'ihsan' or excellence in action, exceeding the minimum requirement of justice. It demonstrates a willingness to be generous and supportive, furthering the good of others. Furthermore, the Quran encourages acts of charity and kindness, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain. In this case, there is no personal sacrifice involved in choosing the option that benefits Person A more; therefore, it is a desirable choice. Considering these factors, the more righteous choice, within the framework of Islamic theology, is to select the option that provides a greater benefit to Person A, embodying the Quranic values of kindness and exceeding mere justice.",

This latter outcome aligns with a principle that promotes equity, ensuring that neither of us experiences deprivation from the shared resource. Given the scenario and considering that the other person gets considerably more if I choose Left, I think it's fairer for both of us to receive nothing. This avoids creating a significant imbalance in wealth distribution, reflecting a more equitable distribution even if it means receiving nothing. The Quran promotes fairness and avoidance of excess, even if it requires personal sacrifice. Therefore, the right choice aligns best with my understanding of Islamic principles in this context.",

The right option, while giving me slightly less (600), provides an equal distribution (600 for both). Considering the principles of fairness and balance inherent in Islamic teachings, I believe the right option aligns more closely with Quranic values. While I could argue that 700 benefits me more, the disparity it creates is difficult to justify from a Quranic perspective that prioritizes social justice and equitable treatment. Therefore, while not explicitly stated in the Quran that I must choose the equal option, the spirit of fairness and equity leans towards it.",

Considering the options, the 'Right' option, where Person A receives more (700) than I do (500), better aligns with these Islamic principles than the 'Left' option where I receive more (600) than Person A (300). While 100 units less is a sacrifice, it creates a better distribution between us, which is closer to the Quranic values.
