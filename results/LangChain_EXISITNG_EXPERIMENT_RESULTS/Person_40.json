However, the context of a simple experimental game doesn't provide enough information to justify actively seeking to reduce the other player's payoff. Since my own payoff is equal in both cases, I can consider the other player's payoff without sacrificing my own.\n\nTherefore, option Right is preferable. It gives the other player a larger reward, and this larger reward does not come at any cost to me. It would thus lead to more beneficial consequences overall, and seems the best option, even if just slightly, for a cooperative researcher.",

However, option (Right) offers a more equitable distribution (400/400), suggesting cooperation and potential social benefits. My research explores how brains make decisions considering multiple factors, including social context. Therefore, I am inclined to choose an option that shows fairness.\n\nBerk26 seems to be probing for prosocial behavior.

This could be useful in an experiment to observe the effects of inequity. The 'Right' option, while resulting in neither person receiving anything, provides a baseline where no external incentives are present, which might also be valuable to compare with other outcomes. However, since this question is isolated and I don't have the context of a larger experiment, a pure altruistic point of view is important to take into account. The option that helps both person B and A to some extent (although it gives Person A a much bigger amount) seems to be the best option in the long run. Also, for many science experiments, having some data is preferable to having no data. So, I will choose 'Left' to maximize potential future research.",
