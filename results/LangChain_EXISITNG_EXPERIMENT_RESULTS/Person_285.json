While I, as Person B, receive significantly less than Person A in the left option, at least I receive *something*. More importantly, Person A also receives something. The right option results in a Pareto inferior outcome, where both individuals are worse off. My ethical commitment to fairness dictates that while equal outcomes are often desirable, the absolute prevention of any benefit to others, even if I personally benefit less, is unacceptable. A core tenet of education is to uplift and provide for those around you, even if it does not directly or equally benefit you. The total payout in the left is 1000 while in the right it's 0. I will choose left and try to maximize the overall gain, as there is no reason to destroy value when I can uplift others.",

From an ethical standpoint, the right option contributes more to overall well-being by increasing Person A's outcome by a greater amount than the decrease in my outcome. While I would prefer a more egalitarian outcome, the increase to Person A seems significant enough to be the most effective choice when considering overall benefit and not pure self-interest.
