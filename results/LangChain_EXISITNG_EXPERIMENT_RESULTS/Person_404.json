My experiences have taught me that cooperation and generosity, even in small ways, can make a difference. Therefore, I will choose the option that benefits Person A more, as it aligns with my values of compassion and social responsibility. The difference between 400 and 750 is significant enough that it outweighs any potential feelings of envy or regret.

The Right option, however, guarantees nothing for either of us, but avoids contributing to a system where wealth is so unevenly distributed, especially considering that Person A obtains 4 times as I do. While not ideal, in this context, choosing the option that ensures zero benefit for everyone is slightly preferable than benefiting under such unequal circumstances.
