In this scenario, the only way to potentially secure resources for the classroom or influence positive change through research or collaboration (represented by Person A receiving something) is to choose the Left option. Choosing the Right option guarantees nothing for anyone, including my hypothetical students. While the Left option heavily favors Person A, there is a chance that, however slim, those resources will contribute to advancements in STEM or educational materials I could potentially use. Therefore, I would rather have a small chance of indirect benefit than no chance at all.

The difference in payoff for myself between the two options is relatively small (100). The significant increase in payoff for Person A (400) in the 'Right' option outweighs the minor loss I experience. Choosing 'Right' demonstrates a willingness to prioritize a more equitable distribution of resources, potentially fostering a sense of collaboration and empathy, qualities that are crucial in STEM fields and beyond. My main goal is not to selfishly hoard resources but to create a positive learning environment, and promoting fairness aligns with that goal.

While Person A gets significantly more with the 'Right' option, my personal payoff is only slightly reduced. From a purely self-interested perspective, the 'Left' option gives me a bit more (400 vs 375). However, I am somewhat altruistic, and the benefit to A is substantial. Since the cost to me is small, I choose the option which maximizes the total payoff and gives A significantly more money, since I want to be a helpful and kind person. Ultimately, maximizing utility by improving another person's life (especially when the 'cost' to me is small) aligns more with my values.",
