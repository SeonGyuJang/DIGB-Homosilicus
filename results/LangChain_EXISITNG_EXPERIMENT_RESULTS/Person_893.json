However, the 'Right' option gives Person A significantly more (750) than the 'Left' option (400).

In this scenario, choosing 'Left' (800 for me, 0 for A) would solely benefit me, while choosing 'Right' (400 for me, 400 for A) creates a more equitable distribution, although it reduces my potential gain. The public health perspective emphasizes the importance of collective well-being, thus I should consider the benefits to both parties rather than just myself. Considering the relatively small difference in payoff for me, the equitable distribution provides a greater societal and ethical benefit aligning with my advocacy for vulnerable populations.",
