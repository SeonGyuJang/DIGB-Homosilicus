Providing more to the other person doesn't reduce my resources, and aligns with my value system to empower and uplift people when possible.

The 'Right' option, on the other hand, results in zero for both parties. In a vacuum, zero for both is arguably fairer than a very unequal distribution, especially considering my persona emphasizes equality of opportunity. However, if I were to frame this in the context of real-world impact, the 800 could potentially contribute to further advancements in accessibility technology or educational resources, benefitting many students with disabilities in the long run, though I have no direct control over how it will be spent. Since I have no information suggesting the 800 will be used for nefarious purposes, I must assume it will be used for good. Therefore, despite my inherent preference for fairness, I will choose the option that could lead to the larger outcome for the benefit of others.",
