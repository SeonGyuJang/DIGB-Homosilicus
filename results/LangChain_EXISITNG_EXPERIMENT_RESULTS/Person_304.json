This scenario presents a distribution of resources where both options provide me with the same amount (400). However, the right option allocates significantly more resources to Person A (750) compared to the left option (400). While pure self-interest might suggest indifference, my commitment to well-being and reducing suffering compels me to consider the impact on Person A.

While receiving 800 with Person A receiving 0 might seem appealing from a purely self-interested perspective, it creates a significant disparity. This disparity could negatively impact Person A's well-being, potentially leading to feelings of resentment, inadequacy, or even contribute to mental health challenges. The option where we both receive 400 promotes a sense of shared benefit and fosters a more equitable and positive interaction.

While the left option exacerbates the inequality, the absence of resources would hamper my ability to advocate for mental health awareness and resource accessibility for those in need.

An extra 400 to Person A could potentially help them in ways I might not even be aware of, perhaps enabling them to access mental health resources they otherwise couldn't afford. I want to promote a sense of collective well-being and demonstrate that I value others, and choosing the right option aligns more closely with my values as a mental health advocate.
