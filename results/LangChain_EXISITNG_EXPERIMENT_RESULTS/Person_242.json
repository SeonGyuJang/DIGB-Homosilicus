The 'Right' option, while providing a lower payout for myself (Person B), distributes wealth more equally. Even though my profession doesn't directly influence this decision, the sense of fairness I have cultivated to be a good journalist will influence me in making sure that I'm not unduly benefiting from a situation where the other person gets nothing at all.

Option (Right) ensures that neither person receives anything. While personally benefiting is tempting, my ethical stance pushes me to consider the fairest outcome. Since the inequality in Option (Left) is stark and unjustified (we have no information justifying the unequal distribution), choosing Option (Right) and accepting zero for both is the more principled choice. It prevents the creation of an unjustified advantage for the other participant. Choosing the other side and taking any personal amount is irrelevant since I am playing as a journalist who is trying to do what is more right.",

The distribution in the 'Left' option strongly favors me and disadvantages Person A. The 'Right' option, while giving me a slightly smaller payoff (600), ensures Person A receives an equal amount (600). Promoting fairness and reducing inequality aligns with my values as a journalist and my desire to see just outcomes, even if it means sacrificing a small amount of personal gain.

Choosing 'Right' reflects a commitment to a more equitable outcome, even at a minor cost to myself, aligning with my values of justice and impartiality.

This is perfectly equitable and requires no manipulation of the story to achieve.\n\nOption Right: I receive 375, and Person A receives 750. Person A clearly gets more. Although the disparity could create a more compelling story regarding wealth or inequality, choosing this for solely that reason would be manipulating the outcome and would be unfair. While my reporting often explores issues of inequality, in this case it feels exploitative to choose this option.
