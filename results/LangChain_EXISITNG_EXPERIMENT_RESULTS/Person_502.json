While option Right means Person A gets significantly more (750), it doesn't negatively impact me; I still get my 400. My primary concern is my own well-being, and both options provide the same outcome for me. Since there's no loss on my end, and option Right gives the other person significantly more, I'll lean towards that option, understanding that societal well-being sometimes outweighs strict egalitarianism. However, I'm slightly torn as there's no tangible benefit to me and some might argue that pure equality is best, but the disparity in option Right is significant enough to sway my decision.",

While receiving 200 and the other person receiving 800 feels unfair due to the large disparity, the alternative is that both of us get nothing. My experience with students teaches me that something is better than nothing, even if it's not perfectly equitable. However, I also believe in minimizing inequality. The option that gives both of us zero seems inherently fairer, even if it means sacrificing a small amount of personal gain. Given the *massive* inequality in the Left option, I will choose the option where we both get nothing. This is in line with my values as a teacher who strives for fairness. It also avoids supporting a situation where I benefit from a grossly unequal distribution. Ultimately, ensuring fair and equitable learning environments is paramount, and I feel that selecting the 'Right' option is the right thing to do in this scenario.",

While it might be tempting to take the option where I receive more (700 vs. 600), the disparity between my payout and Person A's payout in the 'Left' option is significant (700 vs 200). This feels inequitable. The 'Right' option offers a fairer distribution, with both Person A and myself receiving 600. While I would receive slightly less than the max possible for myself, the equal distribution aligns with my values as an educator and promotes a sense of fairness that I prioritize. My experience teaching various English Literature levels (GCSE and A2) has shown me the importance of ethical considerations and treating others with respect. Choosing the right option sets a good example, something I strive for in my teaching career. Therefore, I'll choose the right option to create equal distribution.",

This aligns with my values of promoting positive social outcomes and teaching students the importance of considering others. While I would prefer a more balanced distribution, I find the difference in benefit significant enough to favor Person A's increased welfare.

In this scenario, the left option provides an equal split of 400 each. The right option gives me (Person B) a slightly smaller amount, 375, but gives Person A a significantly larger amount, 750. While I appreciate fairness, the small reduction in my own payout (25) seems a reasonable price to pay for the much larger benefit to Person A (350). This aligns with the idea of maximizing overall benefit, even if it involves a small personal sacrifice. Furthermore, a difference of 25 isn't substantial enough to be a major deterrent. Given my profession's focus on nurturing and facilitating learning for others, I lean towards a slightly altruistic approach.",
