Choosing 'Right' gives Person A a significantly larger share, which could be analogous to a company prioritizing profits over its workers or the community.

Taking the 'Left' option, which maximizes my personal gain but leaves Person A with nothing, feels akin to the systemic injustice that likely contributed to the mining disaster. Choosing the 'Right' option, though it means receiving less personally, promotes a more equitable distribution of resources. This aligns with my values as a historian dedicated to uncovering the truth and promoting social justice. Furthermore, a more equitable distribution is more helpful to society. Although the amount in question is relatively small, the act of choosing the 'Right' option is significant.",

Choice (Right) offers a more equitable outcome, where both Person A and I receive 600. \n\nAlthough I am a researcher, I can still have personal preferences. I value fairness and equality, especially in light of my historical research. Choosing the option that diminishes the disparity between individuals, even at a slight personal financial cost, aligns better with my values and historical awareness.\n\nTherefore, despite the slight reduction in my personal gain, I will choose the option that promotes a more equitable distribution of resources.",

However, the choice between getting 600 for myself and 300 for Person A versus getting 500 for myself and 700 for Person A is not simply a matter of altruism. It's a complex consideration of potential marginal utility. An extra 100 may not dramatically alter my life, but an extra 400 for Person A, in relative terms, makes a larger difference to them.\n\nFurthermore, my research into mining accidents necessitates a certain degree of impartiality and striving for what is 'right', even if it doesn't maximise my direct benefit. A small concession from me in favor of someone else's benefit seems ethically acceptable.\n\nTherefore, while a historian, researcher and investigator, I still need to take care of myself and thus I am not going to pick anything where I am disadvantaged a large margin.",
