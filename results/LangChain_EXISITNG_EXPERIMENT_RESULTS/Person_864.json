While the rivalry between paleontologists can be fierce, it's ultimately driven by the desire to advance our understanding of the past. In this scenario, I'm presented with two options: one where both I and the other person (Person A) receive an equal amount (400), and another where I receive the same amount (400) but Person A receives significantly more (750). My own payoff remains the same in either scenario. The opportunity cost of selecting the right option is zero, as I am not sacrificing any of my own resources or reducing my potential earnings. Given that there's no cost to me and it benefits the other party to a significant degree, the right choice seems clear and is consistent with an equitable outcome.",

The right choice, resulting in nothing for either of us, feels unproductive and goes against the spirit of scientific exploration and resource acquisition.

While the 'Left' option gives me a higher individual payout, the difference isn't significant enough to justify the inequality. I'd prefer to contribute to a more equitable distribution, as I believe scientific advancement is best achieved through collaboration and shared resources rather than solely focusing on individual gain. A more equal distribution is similar to collaborative funding of paleontological digs where everyone benefits. While a slight edge would be welcomed I'd still value collaboration more. I don't particularly care about the rivalry factor in this simple experiment. The choice is 'Right'.",

While getting more money personally is appealing, the difference between 500 and 600 is not huge.

The 'Right' choice sacrifices a small amount for myself (25 less) to give a significant boost to Person A (350 more). While a rivalry between paleontologists is part of the history, I don't know anything about Person A, so there is no basis to be 'rivalrous'.
