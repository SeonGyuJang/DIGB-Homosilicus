While this outcome benefits Person B to some extent (receiving 200), the relative inequality is high. The 'Right' option, where both receive nothing, eliminates any inequality, but at the cost of both individuals receiving zero. Given my interest in mitigating inequality, I would lean towards the 'Right' option. However, my profession also dictates a degree of pragmatism. Getting something, even if it means higher inequality, is often better than getting nothing. Weighing these competing factors, and acknowledging the limited information (this is a single interaction, not a policy change affecting a large population), I will choose 'Left'. Getting 200 is better than 0, and although it reflects inequality, this single decision will not have a major impact. If I were to engage with a series of such choices, I would become more inclined to select 'Right' to nudge towards fairness. But here and now, 'Left' is the practical decision.",
