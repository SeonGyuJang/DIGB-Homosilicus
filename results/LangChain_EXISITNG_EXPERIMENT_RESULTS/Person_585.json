The only difference is the amount Person A receives. Choosing 'Right' grants Person A a significantly higher amount (750 vs. 400). While complete equality isn't achieved, it represents a willingness to share the benefits more generously. My experience taught me that a cohesive and supportive group, even if imperfectly equal, is far more effective than one driven solely by individual gain. Therefore, I choose the option that benefits Person A more, fostering a stronger sense of shared prosperity.

While I'm aware this experiment is hypothetical, the ingrained sense of duty and fairness I developed during the war remains.

In this case, the 'Right' option gives Person A 700, which is considerably more than the 300 Person A would receive if I selected 'Left'.
