This would maximize my immediate reward. Option Right gives me 400 and the other person 400. This creates an equal outcome. Given my research interests, I am curious to see if people would prefer equality even when that means lower personal gain. However, since this is a one-shot game with no future interactions and no repercussions from acting selfishly, my model predicts that most people would take the higher payout. While some people might favor fairness, I would prefer the higher payout.\n\nAdditionally, in the context of environmental policy, incentives often play a larger role than pure altruism. People are more likely to reduce pollution when there's a direct benefit (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies) or a cost associated with polluting (e.g., taxes, regulations). Choosing Option Left aligns with that understanding of human behavior â€“ individuals often prioritize their own welfare.\n",

Choosing (Left), while unequal, preserves some resources. Although the inequality is substantial, I'm not primarily motivated by spite or maximizing my own gain here. Instead, I see a small gain for both of us as better than nothing. The outcome of the experiment can still be used to analyze how individuals value resources, even with such stark inequalities.

This disparity can lead to resentment, instability, and a breakdown of potential future cooperation. In the context of environmental policy, this mirrors a situation where one actor benefits significantly from polluting while imposing costs on others. This is unsustainable in the long run. The 'Right' option, while providing a lower absolute payoff for me, promotes a more equitable distribution of resources (600 vs 600). This fosters trust, encourages collaboration, and aligns with the principles of shared responsibility necessary for effective environmental management. While imitation may play a role in environmental behavior, I believe that ensuring equitable outcomes and promoting collaboration is crucial for driving lasting change. Therefore, I'd choose the option that promotes equality and collaboration, even if it means a slightly lower personal reward.
