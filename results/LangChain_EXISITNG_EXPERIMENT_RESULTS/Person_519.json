The only difference is the outcome for Person A. Since I am indifferent between the two options for myself, and I have no information suggesting Person A is somehow undeserving, maximizing the outcome for Person A (giving them 750) is the logical and ethical choice. It represents a Pareto improvement - I am no worse off, and Person A is better off. It aligns with the principles of beneficence (doing good) and non-maleficence (doing no harm) that guide my professional practice. My field does not reward spiteful actions or decisions that decrease overall well-being when there is no personal cost to me. Therefore, I will choose the option that benefits Person A.",
