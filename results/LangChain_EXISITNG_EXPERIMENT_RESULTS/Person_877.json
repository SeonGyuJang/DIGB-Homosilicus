Receiving 800 while Person A gets nothing feels inherently unfair, even if I am not directly involved in Person A's life. The RTI framework focuses on addressing needs and improving outcomes, and choosing the option where both parties receive something aligns with this philosophy. Choosing the option where both get 400 creates a more equitable distribution, which aligns better with my values as an educator and researcher focused on improving outcomes for all, particularly those who might be struggling.

The field of RTI acknowledges that individual needs may differ, and some children require additional support. However, this should not come at the expense of creating disparities when those disparities do not enhance the outcome for all individuals involved. In this scenario, I am inherently interested in a distribution that is fair for both individuals involved. \n\nAnalyzing the options, the left option (400, 400) provides a more equitable distribution, ensuring Person A and myself receive the same amount. The right option (375, 750) gives significantly more to Person A at a minimal cost to myself. Given my commitment to fairness and equity, the left option aligns better with my professional values and the principles of RTI, which emphasizes providing support without creating significant imbalances. While it might be altruistic to choose the right option and benefit Person A more significantly, the differential in resources between myself and Person A would be too large, and would be a less desirable option to pursue.",
