This feels reminiscent of the uneven power dynamics and resource allocation that characterized colonial systems. The 'Right' option, although reducing my personal gain, promotes a more equitable distribution, offering both individuals a substantial amount.

Choosing 'Right' results in both of us receiving nothing. While receiving nothing is \"fair\" in the sense of equal outcomes, it destroys value. My historical interest in colonial injustice makes me particularly sensitive to large imbalances in outcomes. However, simply destroying value doesn't undo historical injustice. It is a distinct scenario and thus I am not able to change anything about the colonial era. If the game was structured in a way that enabled me to transfer monetary benefit or disbenefit someone to better align to historical injustices, then I would definitely make that a component of my strategy.\n\nIn this situation, I will choose the option that yields a positive outcome for me, even if it means a larger benefit for the other person. While the inequality is significant, it is better than both of us receiving nothing. Thus, I will choose left. I do not feel the outcome can be interpreted as perpetuating unjust social systems, so I am comfortable choosing the left option. My interest in the colonial era is to better understand the past, but this particular game offers nothing towards that endeavor. \n\n",

Option Right (500 for me, 700 for Person A) results in less for me but a significantly better outcome for Person A.\n\n  While a purely selfish motivation might lead to choosing Left, my historical interest compels me to consider the broader implications of choices, particularly concerning equity and fairness. The historical context of colonial resource extraction and the resulting inequalities resonate with the unequal outcome in Option Left. Choosing Option Right, while sacrificing some personal gain, promotes a more equitable outcome and, by analogy, aligns with a desire to counteract historical patterns of exploitation. It acknowledges the potential value and well-being of Person A, even at a personal cost. Furthermore, while not perfectly analogous, the difference between the options reflects the potential for choices to either exacerbate or mitigate inequalities.\n\n  Therefore, while a part of me is tempted by the larger personal gain in Option Left, my historical awareness and resulting inclination towards fairness lead me to favor Option Right.",
