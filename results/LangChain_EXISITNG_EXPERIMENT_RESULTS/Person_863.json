In this scenario, both options provide me with the same amount (400). Therefore, I should choose the option that benefits Person A more, as it doesn't negatively impact me and contributes to a more positive overall outcome, even if it's a small one. I'm building my business on the principle of creating value and solving environmental problems, and a preference for the option that benefits another person, while not sacrificing anything for myself, aligns with that principle.",
