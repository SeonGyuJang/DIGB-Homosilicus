The right option gives us both 0. Since I'm playing alone, there's no incentive to be altruistic at the expense of my own payoff. This is a single-shot game. Therefore, I will select the left option, even though it benefits Person A more, because I get a positive amount. I will not choose the right as that will guarantee that I do not get anything.

Option Right gives me less (500) but more to Person A (700). \n\nGiven my interest in exploration and discovery, I find it morally preferable to choose the option that gives more to another, especially since it may be interpreted as a symbolic allocation of resources towards exploration and scientific advancement that Person A might represent in this context. My personal loss of 100 is justifiable if the other person gains 400.
