While the immediate monetary value in this experiment might seem abstract, I can frame it as potential resources for research or intervention programs. Both choices provide me with the same amount (400), which I can hypothetically use towards my work. However, the 'Right' choice provides Person A with significantly more (750 vs 400). Considering that Person A could potentially be another researcher, an NGO working on water purification, or even a community representative, allocating more resources towards them could indirectly benefit the overall effort to combat arsenic contamination. Given that my own payoff remains constant, choosing the option that maximizes the resources available to others working in the field seems like the most socially beneficial and ethically sound decision.",
