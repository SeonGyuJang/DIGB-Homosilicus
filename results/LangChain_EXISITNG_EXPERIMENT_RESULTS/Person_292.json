My persona doesn't explicitly state an aversion to unequal outcomes or a preference for altruism. I am not explicitly provided with a risk tolerance factor (how important 200 is to me) nor am I told of any possible future interactions. Therefore, I should make a decision using only the given data.\n\n*   **Left:** I get 200.\n*   **Right:** I get 0.\n\nClearly, 200 is greater than 0.
