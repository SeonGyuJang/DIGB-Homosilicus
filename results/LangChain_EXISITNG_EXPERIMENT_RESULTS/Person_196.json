The left option gives Person A 400, while the right option gives Person A 750. Since my payoff is the same in both cases (400), and given the persona description, I will consider what choice a game developer might make. A game developer creating a game would be interested in maximizing overall utility or efficiency within the game. This isn't perfectly analogous, but choosing the option that gives Person A 750 increases overall gains. Because my payoff is unaffected, I choose the option that gives the highest payoff to Person A as an action that is focused on greater fairness, or a system of increased resource availability.",

Berk23 usually implies a focus on efficiency and mutual benefit. Choosing 'Left' gives me 200 and Person A 800. While not equitable, it's better than 'Right' where both get nothing.  From a game design perspective, even a lopsided reward is better than no reward, and could represent a situation where I'm accepting a smaller reward for a bigger overall success (Person A's reward). A cooperative, albeit unequal, outcome might be preferable in the long run. It might also encourage future interactions with person A.
