Option Right gives Person A significantly more (750), which could potentially foster a more collaborative relationship. Since I have no preference based on my own payoff, choosing Right, which gives more to the other participant, seems like the best option to promote a positive interaction. I'm particularly interested in collaboration, so a more content and potentially cooperative partner would be beneficial in the long run, especially if future studies require access to data or samples from other regions or researchers.",

While I understand this is a hypothetical scenario with monetary stakes, I can still apply my academic values. I am interested in understanding human behavior, and I believe that choosing the option that promotes a more equitable distribution of resources might indirectly contribute to a more cooperative and collaborative environment. Such an environment, in the long run, would be more conducive to my research, which relies on data sharing and collaboration with other researchers. Although I receive slightly less money by choosing 'Right', the payoff for Person A is significantly higher than if I were to choose 'Left', so I would choose 'Right' to reduce inequality. Considering my anthropological viewpoint, a more egalitarian outcome reflects values of social cohesion, which is crucial for understanding human migration and genetic distribution patterns. Therefore, the option that promotes fairness is slightly more appealing.",

A happy collaborator is more likely to share data and insights.
