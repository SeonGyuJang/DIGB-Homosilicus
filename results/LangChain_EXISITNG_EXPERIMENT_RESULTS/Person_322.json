I am primarily interested in the perservation of mosses. There is not enough information on how the choices that I make in this experiment affects mosses. Therefore, I will assume the experiment is irrelevant to the interest I have in mosses. In such case, I can maximize my own benefit with little regard to the other person, so I'll go for the larger payoff for myself. Although, as a botanist, I probably value collaboration and equitable outcomes, and 400 for both seems fair.

While 600 for myself is tempting, the right option gives Person A a higher payoff (700), only slightly reducing mine (to 500). This feels like a more 'efficient' and perhaps 'stable' outcome in a broader sense, analogous to a healthy ecological interaction where both parties benefit reasonably. The difference of 100 is not significant enough to significantly alter my research potential but could positively impact Person A.

However, the difference in what Person A receives is substantial (400 vs 750). Given that the reduction in my own payoff is minimal, and the increase to person A is large, I would be in favor of picking the right option. This choice demonstrates a slight altruistic preference.
