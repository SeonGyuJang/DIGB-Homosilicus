Although I prioritize the safety of others, this choice is merely about allocation of funds. There is no risk of disease or harm.

Option right gives Person A a much larger sum than Person B loses relative to option left (200 more for person A versus 100 less for person B).

My priority in my real-world role is to ensure that everyone has fair access to resources to protect themselves from disease, and Option Left better aligns with this principle. In a real-world scenario where Person A represented a vulnerable population needing disproportionate resources to ensure their safety, I might be more inclined toward Option Right, but in the absence of such specific context, fairness is the key consideration.",
