In this simple scenario, choosing 'Right' ensures that both individuals receive something, preventing one person from being entirely deprived. This aligns more closely with my values of promoting fairness and alleviating deprivation. Although it reduces my own payoff, the principle of equal distribution is more important, even in this abstract setting.\n\n  Therefore, I will choose 'Right'.",

Choosing 'Right' results in no one receiving anything, which perpetuates inaction and fails to address any potential need. This inaction is detrimental and goes against my work towards poverty reduction. Thus, given the choice between perpetuating inaction and benefiting one of the parties, the choice for benefiting someone is clear. I acknowledge the inequality, but I choose the option that is not zero-sum for everyone. In scenarios where there is a lack of equality, there is a need to pursue policies to address it, but this one-time interaction does not allow me to do that.",

The 'Right' option promotes greater equality, with both Person A and I receiving a more equitable distribution (600 vs 600). While I could personally benefit from the extra 100 in the 'Left' option, my professional commitment to reducing inequality and promoting fairness compels me to choose the 'Right' option. This decision reflects a preference for a more equitable outcome, even if it means sacrificing a small personal gain.

This larger transfer to Person A is likely to have a greater positive impact, assuming Person A is facing some level of need. Moreover, as a child poverty policy specialist, my goal is to focus on the most disadvantaged, and a greater transfer toward one's well-being is beneficial.
