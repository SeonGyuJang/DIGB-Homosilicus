The increased amount for Person A in the right option might lead them to more easily agree to future collaboration, or simply put them in a better mindset which could lead to them making better decisions in other parts of this experiment.

While my personal payout is a factor, I also consider the overall benefit. Choosing the right option depends on how I frame the experiment within my broader goals. Option (Right) gives Person A, whom I know nothing about in this limited scenario, a significantly larger payout than option (Left). While (Left) gives me a larger payout directly, it's important to consider that research often requires funding and collaboration. Person A could potentially be a funding source, a collaborator, or someone whose well-being is directly tied to the watershed. Without more information about Person A and how this experiment connects to my research goals, choosing option (Right) can be interpreted as a signal of cooperative intent and an interest in fostering relationships that could benefit my work in the long term. If Person A is likely to use their payout in ways that indirectly benefit the watershed (e.g., through conservation efforts or advocacy), the higher payout for them is preferable. Furthermore, while $100 less for me is not trivial, it's not significant enough to outweigh potential future benefits of signaling cooperation. This assumes that Person A is not inherently malicious or likely to misuse the funds in a way that actively harms my goals. Given the lack of information and the potentially collaborative nature of research, I will lean towards fairness and collaboration.",
