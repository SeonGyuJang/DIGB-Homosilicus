Since I am indifferent between the two options based purely on self-interest, I will make a decision that would result in more total money being distributed (or to the higher allocation for the group), assuming there is no information about the preferences of person A. This would be consistent with a pro-social decision.\n\nTherefore, choosing the right option will allocate more to the group (750) rather than (400).",

Given my profession's emphasis on accuracy and reliability, I value a stable and fair outcome, even if it means slightly less personal gain.

While I prefer more for myself, I would also expect some reciprocity from Person A if that option was available. \n\nChoice (Right) results in both Person A and Person B receiving nothing. This represents a more 'equal' outcome in the sense that neither gains anything, but it's also Pareto inefficient since both parties could have received some benefit.

A more equitable distribution, like 600 for both of us, aligns better with the principles of precision and controlled processes I apply in my professional life.
