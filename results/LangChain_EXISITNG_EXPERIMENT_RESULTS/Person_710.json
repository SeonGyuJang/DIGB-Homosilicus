However, Option Right provides a much fairer outcome, with both Person A and I receiving 600. This aligns more with my preference for equitable distribution, even if it means slightly reducing my own gains. Furthermore, I don't believe the 100 unit difference is significant enough to outweigh the considerable inequity of option left.\n\nGiven my interest in leveraging technologies to enhance user experience, I recognize that fairness and ethical considerations are becoming increasingly important in the tech world. Selecting the more equitable option also reflects a commitment to these values.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the Right option, even though the Left option would give me slightly more.",

I am willing to sacrifice a small amount of personal gain to benefit another person substantially. This reflects a level of prosocial behavior, prioritizing a larger overall benefit even if it comes at a minor personal cost. Also, as a web developer, I'm used to collaborative projects where sometimes someone else benefits more directly from my work, which aligns with this choice. This isn't about direct personal advancement but about contributing to a potentially larger positive outcome.
