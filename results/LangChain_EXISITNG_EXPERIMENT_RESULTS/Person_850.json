Abandoning a teammate or focusing solely on personal gain can have disastrous consequences. The choice here reflects a similar situation. Option (Left) gives me a significant personal gain (800) but leaves the other person with nothing. This goes against my core principles of fairness and teamwork, as it prioritizes individual profit over shared benefit. Option (Right), while giving me less (400), provides an equal share to the other person. Even though I am choosing less money, I would rather the other person be equally as happy and share with me.

Choosing the Right option ensures that neither party benefits unfairly at the expense of the other.
