My primary goal isn't necessarily to maximize my own monetary gain in this isolated instance. Instead, I'm observing my own decision-making process and reflecting on how emotions influence my choices.\n\n  Option Left (400, 400) provides an equal distribution. Option Right (400, 750) gives Person A a significantly higher amount. While standard economic theory might suggest indifference between the two options since my own payoff is the same, the concept of fairness and potential feelings of inequity come into play.\n\n  Given that my interest is in understanding how people's emotions shape financial decisions, I will choose option Right. I am particularly interested in how someone might interpret the decision to take option Left. If person A is a believer in equity, they might view option Left as better for both of us and prefer that option. Choosing option Right allows them to potentially benefit from a higher payoff, which could influence their reaction. Moreover, it challenges me to consider whether my own aversion to inequity (if present) outweighs the potential benefit for the other person.\n\n  The goal of the experiment is to see how people make decisions and so I will choose the option that will give me the most data. In this case, I don't have to do anything extra and still gain data about behavior.\n\n  ",

This perception, even in an anonymous setting, can influence my future decisions and potentially damage my reputation if it were to become known that I acted in a purely selfish manner. Furthermore, given my interest in the emotional aspects of money, I recognize that contributing to a more equitable outcome ('Right': 400 for me, 400 for Person A) might lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and align better with my professional values. This is an opportunity to encourage fairness and possibly initiate cooperation. Therefore, even though it means receiving less money, opting for the fairer distribution makes more sense given my long-term goals and professional identity. Plus, in the context of understanding human behavior, observing the other person's choices after this potentially generous move offers valuable insights.",

This feels inequitable. \n\nConsidering Dr. Thaler's work on fairness and the emotional aspects of financial decisions, I recognize that perceived unfairness can lead to negative reactions and distrust. In this hypothetical scenario, choosing 'Left' might be seen as selfish or exploitative, even though it is economically rational in a narrow sense. Such behavior would not align with my professional ethics and desire to understand how emotions shape financial decision-making.\n\nOption 'Right', where both individuals receive 600, promotes a sense of fairness and equality. While I technically receive less money, I believe this option aligns with the broader principles of behavioral economics and my interest in fostering trust and understanding in financial interactions. It also avoids potential feelings of guilt or discomfort associated with a significantly unequal distribution.\n\nTherefore, despite my role as a financial advisor being centered around maximizing financial outcomes, I will choose the option that promotes fairness and aligns with my understanding of behavioral economics.",

My goal is to encourage clients to make decisions in their best interest, and while fairness is important, the core objective here is for me to maximize the money I am receiving (within reason). The difference of 100 is worth it, and Person A is still getting a great amount, so the choice is Left.
