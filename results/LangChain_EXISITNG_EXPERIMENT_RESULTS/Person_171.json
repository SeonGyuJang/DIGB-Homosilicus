In this scenario, both options provide me with the same amount (400). Since my own payout is equivalent in both cases, and Person A receives a significantly larger payout in the 'Right' option, I find no ethical or practical reason to select the left option.

While stem cell research wasn't directly mentioned in the allocation, fostering a collaborative environment via fairness can only benefit overall progress of the field in the long run. My personal inclination toward fairness, especially when the personal cost is not too substantial (only 100 less), leads me to prioritize equitable outcomes.

Although maximizing my own payoff is a natural inclination, the difference between my potential gain in 'Left' and the other person's potential gain in 'Right' is considerable.
