Giving Person A 750 instead of 400 represents a more efficient distribution of resources without impacting my own outcome. My research aims to improve the overall efficiency and benefit of energy systems, and choosing the option that provides more overall value aligns with this principle. Therefore, I will choose the option that gives Person A a higher payoff, even though it doesn't affect my own.",
