Both options give me 400, so I'm indifferent from a purely selfish perspective. Therefore, I will choose the option that benefits Person A more, which reflects a sense of fairness and promoting positive outcomes for everyone involved, a valuable attribute for scientists working together.

Given my persona, I am more interested in collecting data for myself and am less concerned with fairness in this test.

Given my persona values collaboration, contributing to a potentially 'better' outcome in the repeated game by choosing the fair split in (Left) is more consistent with that persona. I value equality, but not so much that I would accept a very low payout for myself. Since the difference between the amounts I receive in (Left) and (Right) is relatively small (25), but the amount the other person receives is significantly larger, the utility from the higher payout of (Right) is tempting. Ultimately, however, I'm going to stick with my initial inclination toward fairness given my persona as it encourages collaboration in the long run.",
