This disparity could trigger negative emotional responses and potentially impact social dynamics, areas I study extensively. Choosing the 'Left' option promotes a sense of equity and fairness, which, in my view, is crucial for fostering positive social interactions.

While the 'Right' option would give me a higher payoff (300 vs. 200), it comes at the cost of Person A receiving a significantly lower amount (100 vs. 200). Given that this is a hypothetical scenario, I'd prioritize the more equitable distribution. Research shows that perceived unfairness can lead to negative emotional responses and even impact cognitive function. Therefore, I choose 'Left' to promote a sense of fairness and potentially a more positive social interaction. In my view, maintaining a sense of fairness, even in artificial settings, can have implications for mental well-being."

Considering the potential benefits of prosocial behavior on both individual and collective well-being, and aligning with my professional values, I believe choosing the 'Right' option is the more ethically sound decision. The slight decrease in my own gain is outweighed by the positive impact on the other person and the promotion of a more collaborative social dynamic.
