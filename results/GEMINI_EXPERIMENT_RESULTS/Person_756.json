This disparity clashes with the principles of shared burden and mutual support so central to Tolkien's works. I am reminded of the Fellowship of the Ring, where each member sacrificed for the common good. Therefore, the 'Left' option, which promotes equality and fairness by giving both Person A and myself 500, is the more ethically sound choice. It embodies the values of community and shared prosperity that I find so compelling in the literature I study.

The principle of equitable distribution, a concept mirrored in the fellowship and shared burdens within Tolkien's narratives, weighs heavily on my decision. Choosing 'Left' reflects a commitment to a shared prosperity, embodying the spirit of cooperation and mutual support that is so vital in overcoming adversity, both in Middle-earth and in our own world. It is, in my view, the more morally sound choice, even if it means foregoing a small personal advantage. Therefore, I choose 'Left'."
