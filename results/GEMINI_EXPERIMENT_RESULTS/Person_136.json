This outcome mirrors the historical imbalances I study, where some unjustly accumulated wealth at the expense of others. Choosing 'Right' would, in a way, perpetuate that inequity, even on a small scale. The 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 500, embodies a sense of fairness and equality that aligns more closely with my values.
