Locke's emphasis on natural rights and the social contract suggests that a just society strives for equitable distribution. While the 'Right' option offers me a greater personal gain (800), it comes at the expense of Person A, who receives significantly less (200). The 'Left' option, though providing a smaller personal gain (500), promotes equality and fairness by granting both Person A and myself the same amount (500). Considering Locke's focus on governmental issues and the role of education in human society, I believe choosing the 'Left' option aligns more closely with the principles of a just and equitable society. Therefore, I choose the option that promotes fairness, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain. In my view, a just distribution is more important."
