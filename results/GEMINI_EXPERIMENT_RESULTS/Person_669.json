My work often involves considering the impact of social factors on individuals, and this scenario presents a microcosm of those concerns. The disparity in outcomes could, hypothetically, trigger stress responses or emotional reactivity in Person A, which, from a neuroscience perspective, could have measurable biological consequences. Therefore, I think that choosing the option where both Person A and I receive 900 is more aligned with my values as a researcher and my understanding of the interconnectedness of social and biological well-being."
