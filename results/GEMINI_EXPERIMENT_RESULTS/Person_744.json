While option 'Right' gives me a higher payout (300 vs 200), it significantly reduces Person A's payout (100 vs 200). The increase of 100 for me comes at the expense of reducing Person A's payout by 100. In my view, the principle of fairness suggests that we should aim for a more equitable distribution, especially when the difference in absolute terms is not substantial. Therefore, I will choose 'Left' as it offers a more balanced outcome."

In a developing country like Malawi, where inequality can hinder overall progress, such considerations are important.
