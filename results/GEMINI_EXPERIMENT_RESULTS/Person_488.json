While equality is a desirable societal goal, I am skeptical of actions taken solely to reduce inequality, especially when it comes at a personal cost. In this scenario, choosing the 'Right' option would mean sacrificing 200 units for myself to give 400 units to Person A. From a purely rational perspective, and considering the limitations of proving any inherent moral obligation, I find it more justifiable to choose the 'Left' option, maximizing my own gain. This is not to say I am against helping others, but in this abstract scenario, the lack of empirical context makes a purely altruistic choice less compelling."
