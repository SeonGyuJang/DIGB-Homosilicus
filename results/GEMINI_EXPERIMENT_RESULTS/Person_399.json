This creates a negative externality, and in business, such actions can lead to long-term problems, such as negative reputation or even legal issues. The other option offers 600 for me and 400 for Person A. While I get less personally, Person A benefits significantly. This suggests a more collaborative and potentially sustainable outcome. In business, collaboration and positive relationships can often lead to better long-term profitability. Therefore, I'll choose the option that benefits both parties, even if it means a slightly smaller immediate gain for myself.
