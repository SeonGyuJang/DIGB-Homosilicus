Some chose to focus on the challenges and potential dangers (the giants in the land), leading to fear and doubt among the people. Others, like Caleb and Joshua, focused on the promise and the potential for shared success. While the \"Right\" option offers me a larger personal gain (1400), it comes at the expense of Person A, who receives only 100. This disparity echoes the negative consequences of the spies focusing on the negative and instilling fear in the community. The \"Left\" option, where both Person A and I receive 900, represents a more equitable and shared outcome. This reflects the ideal of the promised land as a place of abundance for all, not just a select few. While the personal gain is lower, the overall social benefit is higher, aligning with the values of community and shared prosperity that I find compelling in the historical narrative. Therefore, I choose the \"Left\" option because it prioritizes social utility and a more equitable distribution of resources, reflecting the values of community and shared prosperity that resonate with me as a historian studying the Israelite people."
