This additional resource could be reinvested into my research, potentially leading to breakthroughs in hydroponic Wasabi cultivation that could benefit a larger community in the long run. While the other person receives less, the overall impact of my research, boosted by the higher gain, could create a net positive outcome. Therefore, my decision is driven by a utilitarian perspective, aiming to maximize the overall benefit through strategic resource allocation.
