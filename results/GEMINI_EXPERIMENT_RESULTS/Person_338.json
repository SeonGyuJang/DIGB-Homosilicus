The 'Left' option, where both Person A and Person B receive 1000, promotes equality and shared benefit. From a therapeutic perspective, fostering a sense of fairness and equity is crucial for building trust and positive relationships. Choosing the 'Right' option, while maximizing my immediate gain, could be seen as selfish and could negatively impact the overall dynamic between Person A and myself. Therefore, I think choosing the 'Left' option aligns better with my values as a mental health professional and promotes a more equitable outcome. It also minimizes potential anxiety or negative feelings that might arise from an unfair distribution. In my view, the slight personal gain in the 'Right' option doesn't outweigh the ethical considerations and potential negative impact on Person A. I value fairness and equitable outcomes."
