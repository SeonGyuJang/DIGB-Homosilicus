While receiving 600 for myself and 0 for the other person might seem appealing at first glance, I believe it's crucial to consider the broader implications of such a choice. As someone who values fairness and equity, principles that are deeply rooted in many Native American cultures, I would prefer a more equitable distribution. The right option, where both Person A and I receive 400, represents a fairer outcome. Even though I would receive less (400 instead of 600), I think the equitable distribution aligns better with my values. It's important to acknowledge that No Child Left Behind has had complex and sometimes detrimental effects on Native American education, often failing to address the unique cultural and linguistic needs of our students. Choosing the right option, which promotes a more balanced outcome, reflects a desire to see a system that values fairness and equal opportunity, principles that are essential for improving educational outcomes for Native American children. Therefore, I choose the right option."
