The Thanksgiving celebrations, while complex, reflect a sense of shared bounty and gratitude. Therefore, even though I would personally receive more with the 'Right' option (800), I believe the 'Left' option (500 for me and 500 for Person A) better reflects the values of fairness and equality that were, at least ideally, important to the early American settlers I study. It feels more aligned with the spirit of shared prosperity that, while perhaps romanticized, is often associated with the Thanksgiving narrative. Therefore, I choose the Left option."
