While maximizing individual gain is a consideration, the presence of inequality is a significant concern. In the 'Left' option, I receive 600, while Person A receives 0, creating a stark inequality. In the 'Right' option, we both receive 400, which represents a more equitable distribution.

While the 'Right' option offers me a greater personal gain (800 vs. 500), it comes at the cost of a significant disparity, where Person A receives substantially less (200 vs. 500). In my view, a just society strives for equitable distribution, and the 'Left' option better reflects this ideal. The principle of 'justice as fairness' suggests that inequalities are only justifiable if they benefit the least advantaged. In this scenario, the 'Right' option exacerbates inequality without any clear benefit to the less advantaged party (Person A). Therefore, I choose 'Left', as it aligns more closely with my values and commitment to promoting a more just and equitable outcome."
