While receiving 600 is tempting, the fact that Person A would receive nothing in the 'Left' option creates a significant imbalance. From a social welfare perspective, the 'Right' option, where both Person A and I receive 400, represents a more equitable distribution. This aligns with the principles of fairness and resource allocation within a group, which I study. Therefore, I choose 'Right' to promote a more balanced outcome, even if it means receiving less personally.
