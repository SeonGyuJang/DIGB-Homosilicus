While the allure of personal gain, represented by the 'Right' option with 800 for myself, is tempting, it comes at the cost of diminishing Person A's share to a mere 200. This disparity echoes the themes of injustice and the disruption of natural order that pervade 'Macbeth.' The 'Left' option, offering a more equitable distribution of 500 for both Person A and myself, aligns more closely with my values of fairness and justice. It reflects a society where the common good is considered alongside personal ambition. Therefore, I shall choose the 'Left' option, embracing the principles of equity and balance that resonate so strongly within Shakespeare's works and my own scholarly pursuits. It is a far, far better thing to promote fairness than to grasp greedily for individual gain. Furthermore, the pursuit of truth, like the pursuit of fairness, is a worthy endeavor. Thus, I choose the Left option, hoping to contribute to a more balanced and just outcome. 'Fair is foul, and foul is fair,' but in this instance, fair is indeed fair."

Therefore, I choose the right option, as it benefits me more directly, even if it means Person A receives less. It is a small price to pay for the advancement of my own pursuits.
