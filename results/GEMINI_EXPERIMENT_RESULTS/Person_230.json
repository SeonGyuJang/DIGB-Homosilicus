The impact of environmental issues disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, and a similar principle applies here; a large imbalance in resources can exacerbate existing inequalities. Therefore, I choose the 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 500. This promotes a sense of equity, which aligns with my values and commitment to a healthier and more just society.
