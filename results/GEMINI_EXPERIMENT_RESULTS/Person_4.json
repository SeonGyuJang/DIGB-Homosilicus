While I value efficiency and maximizing gains, I also recognize the importance of minimizing disparities to foster a positive and productive environment. In this scenario, the 'Left' option gives me, Person B, a higher payout (600) while Person A gets nothing. The 'Right' option provides a more equitable outcome where both Person A and I receive 400. Although I would receive less with the 'Right' option, the increased fairness and equality is more in line with my values. I believe this choice reflects my commitment to ethical considerations and promoting a sense of shared benefit, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain.
