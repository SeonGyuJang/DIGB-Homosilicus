This disparity clashes with the Franciscan ideals of fairness and compassion. Bonaventure's teachings stressed the importance of seeking the common good and showing preferential treatment to the poor and vulnerable. Choosing the 'Left' option, where both Person A and I receive 500, reflects a more equitable distribution and aligns better with the values I hold dear as a student of Bonaventure.
