Option 'Right', on the other hand, leads to a more equitable distribution (600 for me, 400 for Person A). Although I receive less in absolute terms, the overall outcome is arguably 'better' because it avoids the negative consequence for Person A. Given my interest in cognitive processes and how they are affected by external stimuli and internal states (like guilt), I'm inclined to choose 'Right'.
