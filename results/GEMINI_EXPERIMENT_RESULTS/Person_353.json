In contrast, the 'Right' option, where Person B receives 600 and Person A receives 400, provides a more balanced distribution. Even though I get less (600 vs 1000), the overall outcome is more equitable and avoids the negative consequence for Person A. A more balanced outcome suggests greater stability and less variance in well-being between the two individuals.
