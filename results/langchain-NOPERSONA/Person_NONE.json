The Berk15 experiment aims to understand how individuals weigh these different motivations. \n\nIn this specific case, the difference in my payoff is 100 (700 vs. 600). The difference in Person A's payoff is 400 (200 vs. 600). A perfectly selfish person would choose 'Left'. A strongly inequality-averse person might choose 'Right' to reduce the disparity. A utilitarian would compare the total payoff: Left gives 900, and Right gives 1200. \n\nConsidering that the increase in Person A's payoff (400) outweighs the decrease in my payoff (100) and that there is a fairly high amount of utility in 'Right', I will choose 'Right' to reduce inequality and increase the total payoff.",

Right is more efficient in terms of total welfare.\n3.  **Fairness/Equity:** Left provides an equal split (400/400). Right is unequal (375/750), favoring Person A significantly.
